After the move, he began to celebrate the New Year on January 1st. \r\n\r\n	Solnal is a national holiday in which millions of Koreans drive from the city to the countryside. Many families living in the cities go the countryside to spend Solnal with their elder parents and grandparents. Family is very important in the celebration of Solnal. As part of their Solnal tradition,  Michael shares that his mother would spend a lot of time in food preparation. On Solnal, they would eat dduk guk, which is rice cake soup. This tradition has been brought over to the United States. In addition to eating dduk guk, which is the first meal of the New Year, there are various types of side dishes.\r\n\r\n	Another tradition in their families is seh bae. Seh bae is the time when children and adults would pay their respects to their elders. Children and adults would bow to their elders as they say, “saehae bok manee badesaeyo,” which is a blessing for the New Year. Following the bows, adults would give children money for the New Year. Michael, and along with everyone else, would wear hanbok, Korean traditional clothing on the New Year. \r\n\r\n	Another tradition was preparing a meal to his ancestors before the feast. The first meal of the New Year could only be eaten after bowing to his ancestors.

I have continually asked her how to make the best Kimchi stew, however when I try to make Kimchi stew, it never tastes as good as the one she makes. According to my mother, people believe that the more ingredients put in Kimchi stew, the better the stew tastes, but she does not agree with that statement. All she says that is needed is some well-fermented Kimchi and some meat or canned fish. The meat can be any pork or beef or spam, and for fish it can be canned tuna or mackerel pike. My favorite is Kimchi stew with pork belly. She explained that in order to make the best Kimchi stew, you have to have well-fermented Kimchi without cutting the cabbage, meat, or fish apart. For the first and the last step, she recommends boiling the ingredients for a period of about thirty minutes. While it sounds very easy to cook, when I cook the dish, I put some onions, mushrooms and red pepper paste with the Kimchi and pork belly. However, my mother holds that the onions, mushrooms and paste “mess up” the true taste of the Kimchi stew.

Through these traditional holidays Koreans learned the value of family, kept in touch with their relatives, and carried on the spirit of Koreans. \r\nHolidays today, however, are undergoing a major change.

When I think of Gochu japache, I think of Chinese Korean restaurants where I can have Jajangmyeon, Jjambbong, and Sweet and Sour pork or beef, because Gochu Japache is usually served in Chinese Korean restaurants. The dish is usually served with steamed burns, probably because it is spicy. According to my mother, you want to have green bell peppers, onions, bamboo shoots, pyogo mushrooms, and pork. After that, you need to cut the green bell peppers by 1.2 cm into pieces, cut the onions, bamboo shoots, and pyogo mushrooms the same size as the green bell peppers. The pork then needs to be drained and cut into pieces. Fry one teaspoon of soy sauce, jake (saenggangsool), and eggs each. Cut green onions, garlic, and ginger into several pieces. Then, put everything that has been cut so far and fry it in a frying pan with some cooking oil. After all of this preparation, you have Gochu japache! According to my mother, Gochu japache is food that you want to eat when you have no appetite or when you have to serve a visitor at your home. It usually takes thirty minutes to cook; however, my aunt—whom I consider a cooking master—and who taught me how to cook Yukgaejang, said it only takes ten minutes. When I asked my mom for tips on how to prepare the food she said that she usually uses spicy peppers instead of green bell peppers, but if the dish is too spicy using paprika or glass noodles will add flavor to the dish. Also she said it is better to put soy sauce in the dish before you put the meat broth into the fried ingredients. My mother also told me after the interview that she is a very fast cook, and she does not put much in her Gochu Japache every time she cooks it. She recommended only putting in beef, pepper, garlic and the sauce. However she manages to cook it, my aunt must be a very fast cook.

Because Yukgaejang is hot and spicy, it is eaten often during the summer, because in Korea people believe consuming hot foods during the summer is good for personal health. It came from Gaejangguk (also known as Bosintang or dog soup), but for the people who cannot dog or who prefer not to eat dog, they used beef instead of dog meat, which became Yukgaejang. The main ingredients of Yukgaejang are usually bracken, oyster mushrooms, and a brisket of beef. My family is from Mokpo, a city in the southern province Jeonlado, so cooking there is a bit different from other people in different regions of Korea. In my family, my first aunt is known as a “master cook”. Her food is amazing and I recorded a video in the summer of 2011 when I visited her during my summer vacation. She still lives in Mokpo, which is also my both parents’ hometown. The video took place in her kitchen, and my mother was helping her cook as well. According to my aunt and my mother, to prepare the dish, one or two onions are needed and should be cut in pieces. One or two green pumpkins and green onions are necessary as well. In a frying pan, a small drop of cooking oil and a half spoon of dried red pepper powder should be added. When boiling, it becomes chili oil. Next, add beef in a pot with some nicely aged soy sauce, salt, and crushed garlic. The basic soup (not finished yet) with beef, nicely aged soy sauce, salt and garlic can blend to become many different soups; an example would be seaweed soup. Nicely aged soy sauce is called Jinganjang, but she said it’s called Aeganjang in her area. My mom said beef in America might not taste as good as beef does in Korea when adding it in this mix. Next, the chili oil must be poured into the pot with the basic soup. She does not hesitate to conserve and save as much chili oil as possible. Last, put all of the vegetables in the pot: onions, green onions, and green pumpkin. The addition of green pumpkin is what separates this dish from ordinary Yukgaejang. Green pumpkin helps the taste of Yukagejang. My aunt’s Yukgaejang is one of my favorite foods. One notable highlight of the video is my aunt’s very strong southern Jeonlado accent.','55,282'),(149,57,'','','','','','Public Place','*',0,0,'*',0,0,'17:00:00','2012-03-05','Sunny','English','','Tape Recorder,Notes',NULL,'Michelle Interview 1',50,NULL,'This interview was at Hedrick dining hall around 5:30 pm and it was quite dark outside.

Bimbap is food dish that can be eaten very easily, but it is not easy to make. My mother helped me with instructions on how to make Jeonjubibimbap. First, she said you need to prepare all of the vegetables, such as white radish, spinach, dried radish greens, carrots, bean sprouts, and balloon flower roots. Afterward, it becomes needed to cut them in pieces and place them in a frying pan. The pieces need to be mixed with radish and put in a pot with some water, salt, and sesame oil and then boiled. For spinach and dried radish greens, they need to be cut in pieces and boiled in a pot of water. The carrots should be cut and fried on a frying pan with cooking oil until it is fully cooked. For the bean sprouts, they need to be cut and salt needs to be put on them to boil with water and then taken out to season. Balloon flower roots need to be salted and chopped to boil with some water and sesame oil. When all of the vegetables are ready, they need to be put in a rice bowl and placed in a circle on top of the rice in a neat pattern. Finally, red pepper paste needs to be placed in the bowl and it becomes a very delicious Jeonjubibimbap. Because Jeonjubibimbap has many different types of vegetables mixed in with it, it is a very health meal. It can be eaten any time, and requires significant work for preparation of the vegetables and it usually takes about an hour to cook.

At first, he feels somewhat pressured because I am recording the interview, but the laughter of our two other friends in the car makes him feel more at ease to tell childhood stories, or simply, stories that we can all laugh at. The car-ride is relatively quiet: the radio plays softly, and there is the quiet murmur of Los Angeles traffic and the aforementioned side-comments and laughter of our friends. The interview is interrupted once we arrive at the restaurant (whilst parking), but continues as we wait outside of Daikokuya until seated. It is already nighttime and the weather is relatively cold.

Though there are many people present, their side conversations do not interrupt our conversation and we are able to hear (and record) each other perfectly fine. Our two other friends (one had just been interviewed by me, as well) feel somewhat awkward talking normally while I interview, so they watch on or whisper side comments to one another. Esther has just been present for the other interview and seems to be prepared to answer all my questions: her answers are quick, but she anticipates some of my following questions so she’ll give background information without too much trouble.

It is a very healthy food item because it is made with various different ingredients. Gujeolpan is made with beef, shiitake mushrooms, eggs, shrimp, cucumbers, carrots, and any other left over fresh vegetables. Cut all the ingredients into slices, and fry the beef and shiitake mushrooms. You want to separate the yolk and the egg white to fry them, and cut them into slices. Blanch the shrimp and get rid of the shell. Other vegetables need to be cut slices and fried with salt. All of the different vegetables, meats, and eggs need to be placed on a dish with eight sections and a center section. The white radish needs to be cut into slices in a pancake shape, salt and vinegar down pickle, and then place in the center while the other various food items need to be placed categorically into the other sections. When you eat, you can wrap the various food items into the pancake and eat with the mustard sauce. It usually takes over an hour to prepare this dish. She said that usually people use wheat flour to make the pancake shaped slices, but my mom prefers to use white radish for better taste and texture.

The adults present appeared to be discussing logistics and future business plans with their company partners or simple acquaintances. With the smell of coffee wafting through the air, we situated ourselves at a rectangular table in the center of the room.

I stood up and purchased a hot coffee (black) for Mr. Chun, and a bottle of Perrier water for myself. We faced each other directly and I placed my laptop diagonally from our view, so it would not interfere with the dynamics of our interview. Mr. Chun appeared to be relaxed and deep in thought, paying no attention to the bustle around him.

The bookshelves were decorated with pictures of him and his wife, as well as awards he received from the military and pictures of him as a soldier. In the living room were two sets of single couches - I sat on one side, and my uncle and Mr. Kim sat on the other. We were offered instant coffee in glass floral cups, which remained on the table as we did not have much time to drink. The small puppy which came with us to the apartment was locked in Mr. Kim\'s bedroom, as he did not want it to bother us during the interview.

In the corner of the room, a space was designated for the dog and his various toys - mostly furry and fluffy in style.

Upon sitting in her living room couch, I noticed heavy displays of handmade jewelry framed behind glass-doored cabinets. The colors of her living room were themed with lime green, beige, and occasional tones of brown. By the high quality of her furniture fabric and flat screen TV, I assumed she had moved from a more luxurious place to her current residence in Ardmore. After Mrs. Lim opened the door, she went to the kitchen to prepare some Chinese tea and stayed in the kitchen as I placed my laptop next to me on the couch. The atmosphere of the place was intimidating at first, but only because most of her possessions were stored behind tall glass cabinets. Because her husband was in the other room with her grandson, I briefly entered his plainly decorated room in order to bow and say hello. Closing the door behind me, I went back into the living room space and pressed my feet on the furry white carpet. On the walls were painted pictures of what seemed to be oil paintings of young Caucasian girls in white dresses with parasols, and another painting of a brown-haired girl picking flowers in what appeared to be a Parisian marketplace. Mrs. Lim sat right beside me, displaying her wonderful hospitality through a cup of tea and a plate of evenly sliced fruit. Through the walls of her grandson\'s room, we could hear the occasional muffled voices whenever they became excited about the subject they were discussing.

The prices on the menu were surprisingly high, but the open atmosphere and high ceilings of the restaurant were something different from other Korean restaurants. One of the servers, a woman in their middle age, was dressed in traditional Korean clothing. The entire mood of the restaurant was less casual than other Korean barbeque settings, and I received the impression that the restaurant had put in a great deal of effort to portray a traditional, Korean mood.

She believes that the fan death phenomenon is real, although she admits that it is not scientifically proven. She says that if one sleeps with the fan on, the temperature of the room drops, which is very unhealthy. She relates this to what Koreans call “입돌아간다,” which is when your mouth turns to the side of your face because you sleep in a cold environment. Kim even says that this happened to her personally, although she did not die. She says that she slept with a fan on and she woke up severely ill. It was not a cold and she claims that the only source for the illness was from her sleeping with the fan on. She says that acupuncture is the cure to this phenomenon and that although she can’t explain the science behind it, she claims that people will die if they sleep with the fan on in a small room, especially when the windows are closed. Her mother often told her that she knew of someone who died of the fan death while she was growing up and she heard about it often in the news, but she doesn’t know of anyone personally who died of this fan death.\r\n	When I told her that this cause of death had only been reported in Korea, she said that she admits that it is not scientifically proven. Thus, she came to the conclusion that Koreans must have created this myth to reduce their electricity bills. She came up with the hypothesis that because Korea is so humid in the summer, people must have been glued to their fans, which then resulted in a high electricity bill.

On this day, all family members gather at their hometown village and eat rice cake soup, play traditional Korean games, and have a good time. Younger children bow to elders and receive presents or money. The lunar New Year is important because everyone becomes one year older. Since we don’t have a large family here in America, we celebrate New Year only by eating rice cake soup. The bigger the family, the happier the lunar New Year is. \r\n\r\n\r\n','Lunar New Year Celebration.

Koreans used to sleep on the floor, but underneath the floors there are coals for heating up the floor. maybe when it\'s cold the gases get turned on, and the gases might suffocate the person who is sleeping.\r\n\r\n(the following is from a follow-up email)\r\n\"Okay, so it is believed that koreans are able to die from the coldness of the AC. The bodies get cold and the brain is unable to react to the cold because of the sleeping state. Its more or less like hypothermia during the sleep. And so most korean mothers i believe do tell their children that if they are hot at night, at least have the stomach covered with a blanket. The stomach abdomen area seems to be the most crucial for body temperature.\r\n\r\nThe ghost story is that koreans are sensitive to being cold at night so when the bodies get cold, the person wakes up to get a blanket. However, they are unable to move their body. They say that its called scissorlock and its when a \"ghost\" is pressing down upon your body, your chest area. I know that some of my highschool friends that were korean have supposedly experienced this scissorlock.\r\n\r\nAnother take is that the AC prevents air circulation in the room or space, even in the car. Like when you drive and the AC is on, you get a headache? its due to the AC. And so the lack of oxygen and circulation from the AC causes some deaths.\"','','',0,0),(16,16,23,23,'Fan death ','Fieldnotes','SK: What have you heard about fan death? \r\nHK: Fan death is believed to be caused by a mixture of hypothermia and circulation of harmful chemicals in the air as a result of sleeping in a room with the doors and windows closed. \r\nSK: Do you know of anyone who died from having a fan left on in their room at night? \r\nHK: Not anyone I know, but it\'s in the newspaper sometimes. There was a story in the newspaper a couple of years ago about an old woman around 70 years old who was found dead in her room at her daughter’s apartment. The weather in Korea is not only hot, but humid. The woman apparently left her door open when she went to sleep. In the middle of the night, the daughter decided to turn on the air-conditioner. She closed the door to her mother’s room because she knew her mother hated the draft that came into her room as a result of the air conditioner. However, during the middle of the night, the woman got hot so she turned on the fan in her room, not knowing that the door was closed. It was said that the wind generated by the fan stirred up dormant spores in the room, which affected the woman’s lungs.

He is a Korean-American who is deeply rooted in both Korean and American culture. Interview was over the phone on Monday evening January 16, 2012.\r\n	Upon asking Andrew about fan death stories, he did not know any specific ones, but knew that in general, many Koreans believed in similar kinds of stories like that, but the newer generation of Koreans, (including himself) were less likely to believe these things. He knew that fan death was an obvious and commonly believed misconception among traditional Koreans, but is less likely believed among more modern generations of Koreans Korean-Americans. He also noted that many Koreans believed that it is unsafe to open both a window and a door in your room while sleeping. \r\n	When asked about a family holiday, Andrew spoke about New Years’ for Koreans since it was recent. Of course, the first and most prominent occurrence was receiving money from elders. Similarly to Chinese New Years’ customs, receiving money from elders was common among both traditional immigrant generations and even among the newer more Americanized generations. Andrew agreed that Koreans celebrated New Years on January 1st though, instead of at a different time (like for the Chinese). Like a traditional line-up, Andrew explained that all the youth would line up and bow to their elders and discuss their education, success, jobs, and applications for jobs and school before they would receive any money. Eventually, they would eat a traditional rice cake soup which symbolized continuing to live and grow for the next year. \r\n\r\n','','',0,0),(18,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19,37,25,18,'Fan Death Story','Fieldnotes','This is the transcription of the interview with my friend about the fan death story.','Korean 183 Fieldwork.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',11617,1438757),(20,17,9,12,'Fan Death Story','Fieldnotes','G: So, do you know any stories about an actual fan death story? \r\nS: Well there was a story that my mom told me when I was younger about this boy that lived in Busan and during the entire summer it was really hot and the boy constantly complained about why they don’t turn on the fan while they sleep.

I remember that day clearly even though I was only seven. It was a day before the Luna New Year, so many relatives came to our house and stayed for a couple of days. One of them was my cousin, who started all the drama happened that day. The only room that had a fan was my grandfather\'s reading room, which was located at the very back of our apartment unit. The room only had one small window, and because of its location at the very back of the apartment, the cool air flowing out of an air conditioning machine could not reach it. The fan was the only cooling device. My grandparents always made sure that nobody, especially the little ones in my family, slept with a fan on in that room. Because of the myth of \"Fan Death,\" we thought that it would be suicidal to sleep in that closed room while the fan is on. But, the cousin, who was new to our house\'s rules, did not know about it. Thus, one day, everyone except my cousin, who was about ten years old, decided to go out and shop things for our celebration of the Luna New Year. After two or three hours, with our hands full of shopping bags, we went back to the apartment. My aunt, who is a mother of the cousin, started to look for my cousin, calling his name - \"Se-hyun-a! Se-hyun-a!\" Nobody answered. We figured that he might well be preoccupied playing video games. After ten or twenty minutes of putting things into a refrigerator, my aunt became a little anxious. \"Where is he?\" She opened the bathroom door, looked into the bath tub, went out to a balcony, looked under the kitchen table, and even shouted outside of the apartment to a playground to see if he was there. He was nowhere to be found. 	The last place to look for was my grandfather\'s reading room. My aunt hurried to that room, slowly opened the door. She shouted. My cousin was lying there with the fan on, the small window closed. My aunt thought her son died. We thought it too. Suddenly, my cousin woke up without knowing what was going on. Even though we now do not believe in the \"fan-death\" myth, I still do not sleep with my fan on. Maybe it is because I am so scared that my mother would scold me as my aunt did to my cousin.

But actually the Korean start to celebrate the occasion is on the new year’s eve, on that day, people clean up their houses. \r\nKorean needs to wake up in the early morning on the first day of new year. The first thing needs to be done is pray to their ancestors. They also have to do a thing called “cha rae”. “cha rae” is like a kind of memorial service for ancestors. They will also serve several special food items to their ancestors, and the food that served must be displayed in a special korean traditional order way to put the food on a table,어동육서(魚東肉西—fish on east, meat on west) and홍동백서(紅東白西—red on east, white on west) the most popular two rules. 어동육서  means put the seafood or fish on the east side and meat on the west side, and 홍동백서 means puts the red one on east side and puts the white one on the west side when Koreans put the food on the table. After they served their ancestor, they usually share the drinks called음복.\r\nAnd then, lots of korean will dress up설빔(also called “hanbok” the traditional Korean dress) and make a deep bow (sae bae)to the elder people, like parents and grandparents.

He explained fan death multiple times in different ways because I had a hard time understanding the logic behind fan death.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Korean words written in Hangul are not the only Korean words spoken during this interview. The words left in Hangul are particularly harder to translate without some meaning misconstrued or lost, so they are left in Hangul.\r\n\r\nM: What is fan death?\r\nO: If a fan faces your face, it is definitely no good because you can\'t intake the air properly. When you breathe in air, a certain amount is supposed to go into your system, but the fan lowers the density of the air. The atmosphere of the earth is like a huge air chamber where breathing is easy. But in a small area (like a bedroom), the fan is continuously and artificially moving the air towards one direction.\r\nM: But how is it that you can die from that?\r\nO: In a small room, there is a small amount of air. If you turn on the fan, it forcefully blows wind/air, so it moves the air away from your face and mouth. So you intake less air by the minute. Lesser and lesser air. By 9 hours later, you\'re breathing in considerably less. It lowers your body temperature forcefully.\r\nM: How does it lower your body temperature forcefully?\r\nO: When you intake cold air, your body can\'t function naturally. The body regulates temperature with sweat, but with the fan blowing with sweat on your body, your body becomes colder. Like when you were young and you were sick with a high fever and temperature, we took off your clothes and put cold water on you to lower your body temperature... Remember? The fan lowers your body temperature. Your body doesn\'t know if there\'s a fan present or not, so its just going to continue to lower your body temperature because the fan is artificial wind.\r\nM: Huh?\r\nO: The outside of your body becomes colder and colder because the inside of your body doesn\'t know there\'s a fan present. You exercise to get warm, right? But when you\'re sleeping, you are not and cannot do anything (like exercise) to get warm, so your body just becomes colder and colder.\r\nM: Do you know anyone personally who has died from this? Or have you heard of any?\r\nO: Uh... I don\'t know anyone personally, but I read about it in the newspaper several times. It sometimes happens.\r\nM: When did you read about it? How many times?\r\nO: When I was young, I heard about it. And the most recent time was maybe 5 years ago. But I\'ve heard about fan deaths at least 3 times in my lifetime.\r\nM: How do those people know they died from the fan? Autopsies?\r\nO: No autopsies, but they died because they couldn\'t breathe.\r\nM: But you don\'t know anyone personally who died from it?\r\nO: I don\'t know anyone who died because people who died from that are 무식해 (ignorant). They heard about it, but they were uneducated and ignorant. They thought, \"I\'m going to turn on the airfan for only 30 minutes, and then I\'ll turn it off after 30 minutes.\" But what if they fall asleep? They die.\r\nM: Who told you that you\'d die from this?\r\nO: Parents and adults.\r\nM: Who told them?\r\nO: They read about it from articles in newspapers because they didn\'t know much because those automatic timers were not invented yet. So people investigated and studied those fan deaths. So then because of these deaths they made those automatic 30 minutes/1 hour timer controllers. When I was young, the electric fan was not popular. When I was 5 or 10 years old, there were no Korean-made electric air fans. They were imported from Japan or USA. Then some companies like Golden Star and Samsung started making fans, primitively, because it was popular. The fans became better and better and by around the 1980s, Korea became the best maker of electric fans. In the meantime though, people were dying with their new air fans in the home. So people began to think that air fans are dangerous. People studied this and found that they weren\'t getting enough oxygen. Companies who make air fans made these automatic timer option fans and those are not dangerous.\r\nM: But didn\'t you say people died from it recently?\r\nO: Still these deaths happen even with high-tech things because people are still using the lower quality fans without the automatic timers. Strong people don\'t die because you will wake up or turn around or something. Those people who die are weak-bodied. Patients, young people, infants, elderly... people like that cannot move so the fan will forcefully blow air into their face/mouth/nose. But these deaths are rare... maybe one out of million or ten million or 100 million.\r\nM: Why is it rare?\r\nO: Because everyone knows that it\'s not good for you.\r\nM: So what do you think when I tell you that this hasn\'t occurred in any other countries?\r\nO: Other countries haven\'t had this because they probably open their windows.\r\nM: What happens if you open your windows?\r\nO: So 공기 (air/atmosphere) moves around if a door or window is open. For example, if a fan is turned on outside, nothing happens. But in a closed room, you can\'t intake the air from outside.\r\nM: But Koreans don\'t open their windows or doors?\r\nO: Koreans don\'t open their windows or doors because it\'s dangerous. There\'s robbers and murderers. It (fan deaths) happens everywhere, but it\'s not worldwide news. So New York people wouldn\'t hear about this. Lady Gaga getting cheek surgery would be worldwide news, but this is not. **Little arguing between O & T** T wants to say something.\r\nT: Hi, I looked up some stuff on the internet... It says that professions don\'t even know if its real or not. These news is only from Korea. If your body temperature varies by 10°C, so 38.5°C +/- 10°C, you die. The fan can\'t change your body temperature that much. So normal people can\'t die because you\'ll wake up. This isn\'t the MAIN reason to their deaths because their bodies are already weak. But when we were young, Grandma and Grandpa told me and I saw it on the news and stuff. But if you open the window, your 입돌아가s definitely. If you open the window and cold air comes in, your mouth turns around. The woman that works in from of me... that happened to her last year.\r\nM: When?\r\nT: I can\'t remember when exactly.\r\nM: Why does that happen:\r\nT: I don\'t know why exactly. I just know that it definitely occurs. We\'ll have to investigate/study that...\r\nO: I think about it.... If one side [of your face] is only continuously cold and the other side is a different temperature, and you cannot move....\r\nT: People who have different diseases, babies, elderly, drunken people,... those are the people who die from this. But if you turn it on your face (a healthy person\'s face), it\'s still not good though. See, like O... He HATES it when your turn the fan on his face. He always covers his face if there\'s air blowing into it. He moves the air condition vent away from him in the car. He covers his face from the fan at home. He says that he gets sick every time the fan turn on his face. He hates it.\r\nM: Oh yeah.

Uh, our family members they gather and always… always at like  the oldest sons’ place or wherever your grandparents are. So they gather. Uh, always the girls, or like the moms, they always go to the kitchen. And the dads they always, they’re always gathered in front of the TV, they’re watching sports or whatever’s on TV. Like uh, special programs for that day, like those stuff. And the kids, they always go into one of the rooms. They play computer games, or like girls, they talk or like whatever they do. Uh, so, for the kids and the fathers, they always wait for dinner. And always the kitchen they make like juns so uh, most typically it’s like hobak jun, or they slice fish and they also make jun with that. And ah, I think it’s called sahm-jun, there’s like three kinds of stuff that you put on a stick and there they like they have pah, they have like crab meat, mat-sal, and sometimes gogi. And they have dongeurang ddeng so. So dinner, after we eat dinner uh we do saebae always we do it with family. If the grandparents are not there we always do it for the other families. So our uncles or aunt they always give us money. Uh, and for the kids it’s always for the money, but they always give it to the parents so yeah for them they just do it, go back, and then play by themselves. All the parents, if your grandparents are there, they do saebae too. But it’s rare. It’s they’re always in the countryside so unless you go down for Sul-nal. Uh, if they do they always do it to their parents. And after that, uh, all your mothers, they always talk, they always sit around like a table and just talk about like their husbands or their life. They chat. And their fathers they always take out hwatu. And they use the saebae dons to sort of like bet. It could be small-scale, but it gets bigger and bigger. It gets competitive, it sort of becomes like a competition between families. And sometimes the kids are like “Oh dad, you suck, like you should do better” even though they don’t know how to play, they just see like money going out and giving it to your uncles so they keep on doing that. They keep on doing that until the kids nag their parents like all that stuff saying “I want to go home and sleep” and that sort of settles that day. Like if it was time to go, that would- yeah that’s a typical Sul-nal or like even Chuseok. Like Chuseok is like that but Chuseok, like the foods are different, sometimes you make songpyun but it’s mostly the mothers that make it for you. So that’s a typical Korean holiday.\r\nIs that the kind of holiday or like typical agenda that your family follows?\r\nYeah. My family follows, and even my friends when I hear what they did. I think it’s a typical thing, like they always follow the same thing. For most families I guess.\r\nA: What is like your earliest memory of celebrating it. Like, do you remember anything, like how has your view changed as a child and growing up, does it mean more to you or?\r\nB: When you’re a child, you just do it because your parents tell you to do it. You don’t know what’s happening, it’s just the first day of the year. You don’t know, you don’t know why you’re doing saebae, they just give you money. So like you’re so excited to buy junk food with that. But as you grow, you know the meaning of it and I guess, you sort of do saebae with a meaning. It’s sort of like a blessing also saying live long or sort of like that. It’s not just getting money, yeah, it’s just telling like, we say in Korean ddukdam, like the parents give you like good blessing or like good advices, like good words to you for that year. But also for the kids, we say good stuff back. So you sort of get to know the meanings of it, like why you do it. You learn in schools. So i guess that’s different from when you’re a kid, when you just do it because your parents tell you to do it.\r\nA: Do you have like a specific, like a memory or like, yeah\r\nB: Memory?\r\nA: Yeah, about it- like a funny thing that happened or a story to share about like your family and how they do Sul-nal.\r\nB: Uh, there is a lot. But like one thing was saebae, there’s a certain thing for saebae like everyone has to follow, like for example guys, I’m still confused. But it’s either your left or right hand that has to go up. I think for guys it’s right hand, yeah, and then you learn it in school too, but you always get confused, so you always noonchi-bwah like each other. Like “what’s right, what’s right.” And uh, one thing is. I think I was really young, like elementary school, you always do saebae once. And if you do saebae twice, it’s for someone who died. And I didn’t know that, I thought if you do it twice you get more money. So I accidentally did it twice, and then my parents were shocked. They were like, “You can’t do that.” And it was in front of my grandparents and I was like “I just wanted more money.” And they told me that’s the meaning, if you do it twice it’s for someone who passed away. And for like suhlnal or like those holidays, you just do it once so that’s one thing I never forget to do, just once do saebae.\r\nA: Um, do you, do you feel like the, like Korean-Americans kind of alter the celebration a little bit to make it like, i don’t know, different? \r\nB: Yes, it’s sort of honest to be different like in Korea. \r\nA: Like for you\r\nB: Yeah for like I was in both. Like in Korea, they always follow the holidays, always go down to your grandparents. But in Korea, i guess, since people around you don’t do it a lot.\r\nA: In Korea or America?\r\nB: Here. So in Korea, everyone does it. So they always go down, they always do it, we always have a family reunion. But here, I guess, you sort of lose that meaning- it’s just Sul-nal, that’s it. Or you just eat ddukgook and that’s it. Nothing happens especially like for Chuseok, you just buy songpyun in a market and just eat it. But Korea, they- a lot of people make it that day. They always gather, they make it and then eat it. So, I guess here, it’s just oh it’s just a special day, that’s it. And you follow the normal pattern of your day, or maybe just rest home. \r\nA: What does it mean to you, personally, if it has a meaning?\r\nB: Those days? \r\nB: For, I guess, you just follow it. But for Sul-nal it’s mostly about oh, I’m getting older. One year older. But um, I guess following those holidays, you sort of think about “Oh, I’m still Korean.” That thing. Like even though you’re in America, you’re still following that Korean tradition that happens in Korea but you’re just doing it in America. So, I guess some people might think like oh, I’m still Korean, even though I’m in a different, like, foreign place. And I think those holidays sort of reminds you of your identity. You keep on doing it because it’s different for other people, other races don’t do like saebae or yongdon or all those.

During the meal, the family talks about all of the different things that they have accomplished within the past year. \r\n     In the nights between each day o the celebration, the family will sleep together in the same room.  When the family members are in the same room, the parent will tell their children about their own childhood and go through many \"when I was your age\" stories.  Mark reflects that this may be one of the reasons why many young people do no particularly enjoy this holiday. Furthermore, the younger generation considers this holiday to be boring and embarrassing.  Not only do the older generation talk about their youth, which has very few parallels between Mark\'s generation, but he and others his age are subjected to awkward questions.  He said that family members like to talk about how well their own children are doing, and in turn, ask others among their children\'s age group what their lives are like, mainly to compare.  Among some of the popular conversation topics include ones romantic life and school (specifically grades).

SO I interviewed my friend Jinho, and I did not expect that he just gave me a fantastic introduction of their New year customs, which greatly help me to know about Korean traditions. Therefore I got a clear summary below.\r\nKorean New Year celebrations normally begin at Sut dal kum(New Year’s Eve) with a thorough cleaning of houses and lightings. To complete the preparations Koreans normally take a hot bath while burning bamboo sticks to expel the evil spirits. While making the final preparations people are expected to maintain lighting in all their rooms. Lighting of rooms is an important part of the celebrations since it gives the New Year the desired warm welcome.After the extensive preparations, the much-awaited Seol-Nal arrives and it is a special day in the life of every Korean. On this day, every Korean is expected to be in new clothes that have never been worn before. Women spent the rest of the day preparing delicious meals to their families while children spend most of their time in the company of elder member of the society.\r\nI think it is interesting to celebrate the New Year in Korean style. First, every activity undertaken on the day has attached reasons and consequences. Although Seol-Nal is celebrated with serious ritual and traditions, the day ends with fun and entertainment where people play their favorite games such as kite flying and skiing.','','',0,0),(56,34,56,52,'Calendrical Holiday ','Fieldnotes','(the interview was done in Korean, and these are the notes transcribed in English)\r\nWhen I was 10, during Chu-Suk, I went to the cemetery with [your] grandma and grandpa. (Sung-Myo; a Korean tradition of ancestor worship, and is usually done at the grave with many food items) \r\nThe cemetery was extremely far and the grave was even farther. It took about an hour and a half hike up the mountain to get to the grave, so I had to wear comfortable clothes. \r\nAt the grave, we met all our relatives there. We are at the place for about half a day, because we eat there and all the relatives get together. We leave the house around 7, and take the bus about an hour and half. Then, it\'s another hour and half up the mountain. It took a long time to find the grave because not only was it up in the mountain, but also we got lost for about 30 minutes, since all the graves look the same. Your grandpa has a bad sense of direction too. At the grave we bowed and did the worship process and then ate. \r\nI enjoyed eating the lunch in the mountain. There\'s many special foods that we only ate on Chu-Suk. There\'s five different colored vegetables (namool), special pancakes (meat, oysters), bulgogi, yak-gwa, yak-sik, different fruits, and even a special type of candy that goes on the table. The candy comes in many bright and highlighter type colors. Eating the foods was the fun part. \r\nLater, after the bowing and the eating, we also took care of the grave. We cleaned the outside of the grave and put flowers, and took out weeds. We planted flowers and with small trees next to the grave. We also meditated quietly for a bit, thinking of our ancestors. \r\nFinally, we came down from the mountain and took the bus back home again. \r\nOverall, it was boring and I did not like it very much. It was very tiring and I went to sleep as soon as I got home. Looking back, I wish that I didn\'t always have to go because it was so boring and tiring.

He was forced to join the army three months after the war had started with the North invading the South. At that time, he was a student, but he had to give up his studies as he was drafted for war. About three months into the war, my grandfather surrendered to the American armed forces during a battle and was taken as a Prisoner-of-War. He was a POW at the Kŏjedo POW Camp until the end of the War. In the camp, there was a lot of tension between the pro-Communist and anti-Communists. The pro-Communist/North often physically attacked the pro-South and my grandfather claims that if it hadn\'t been for Missionary Vockel, he would have lost his life. The pro-Communists had much more in number and were much stronger, so they beat many pro-South POWs to death. The missionary asked for the pro-South POWs to be moved to a different place and so my grandfather\'s life was changed. He stayed in the POW camp until the end of the war. At the end of the war, he asked if he could remain in South Korea. There were many other POWs who wanted the same, so they were given the choice to either stay in South Korea or go back up to the North. \r\nMy grandfather has been worried for a while concerning a theory that has been gaining popularity in Korea. He says that some people these days are saying that the South invaded the North, instead of the opposite. He says that someone even had the nerve to tell him that the truth (that the South invaded the North) will only be accepted after his generation passes away.\r\nHe also discussed the impact of the Korean War in Korean History and how it changed after the War. He also touched a bit on his life in North Korea before the war and his experiences in the communist country.\r\n\r\nThe audio was a bit cut off because I recieved two calls while I was recording in the beginning.

He said that his mom doesn\'t really care what kind of girlfriend he has, and his mom always wanted to invite the girlfriend to come over to have dinner. However, Lee didn\'t do so because he was afraid that his sister would express her bad attitude toward the girlfriend since his sister is a very straightforward person.

However one day, he was constantly hurting, so he took a leave and rested at home.\r\nHis friend offered him a job that wasn\'t too hard (physically). Three years later, they all went on a business trip (spring around May when he passed away). Her father was constantly had indigestion, so he wanted to drink SODA, but accidentally drank disinfectant. While the person who just tasted it wasn\'t in much harm - his tongue was only on fire- her father swallowed it. It was too late. and he passed away.\r\n Freakishly, the same friend who introduced him to the job, had a dream about someone taking a medicine. When he woke up, remembered he didnt lock his medicine cabinet. \r\n A couple days later, the rest of the people visited a monastery, where they met a monk. As he asked for an offering (siju), the friend chased him away. The wife, superstitious about bad omens that could occur for rejecting offerings, went to find the monk, asking people for his whereabouts. Scary thing, no one knew who she was talking about. Coincident or not, her husband, distracted by a blue body of water, fell into it and drowned.\r\n  \"Because of school, I wasn\'t able to be next to my father\"\r\n School was far, so she often stayed at her relatives\' place. She was in the same year as her aunt. They were very competitive. In order to get to the school, she had to walk up and down three hills each way.\r\n  \"Maybe that\'s why I walk so well right now\" (I completely agree. For a women who is 88, she can walk longer than me)\r\n After her young aunt got married, her grandfather offered her family to live in a house which was closer to her school. However, the house was so big for their small family, and it was scary. So, they instead asked to switch house - they would get the grandparent\'s house while the grandparent\'s get their house. \r\n \"Oh your great great grandmother. That woman. She was very materialistic, so she was more than happy to oblige.\"\r\n\r\nENGAGEMENT (3 years without ever meeting him)\r\n\"There was this grandpa that always visited your grandpa\'s pharmacy. He always told your grandfather that he would be in charge of your marriage\"\r\nA grandmother came from your grandpa\'s family to see me at a meeting (sŏn).

My grandpa\'s father wanted to send his older son off to marriage before he sent my grandpa off. The older brother was sent to jail because he was linked to his \"Communist\" friend. He was in jail for 3 years.\r\n\r\n[She tells the story about the brother and his wife. Unlike my grandpa, his brother did what we wanted to do with no one to stop him and saw his betrothed right away. Persistent, charismatic, and good-looking, the brother had everything going for him. However, it all changed when he was drafted for the army. He got married in July and then entered the army in December. After that, his wife lived husband-less for her remaining 70 years. \r\n\r\nMARRIAGE:\r\n In September, they got married. They did the traditional marriage(kusik): wearing hanboks, exchange of the geese, riding the sequin chair (Kama). She further explains the exchange of the gifts (honsu googyung).\r\n \"I will never forget your grandpa. So many people came over to the house to see the goods that was brought. My family didn\'t have much, but we were in charge of blankets. I didn\'t know at that time, but a couple of my aunts were gypped in buying the blankets. Right when the people were about to see the gifts, your grandpa came in suddenly and asked what they were doing. It was strange since it wasn\'t even lunch time, yet he stopped by without any notice. Once he found out, he shooed everyone away, saying that they had no right since they weren\'t in charge of the goods. \'If anything, I will be the one buying it for her.\' Those words, I am eternally grateful and relieved.

However, as she got married, she honed her skill in cooking, much to her husband and his father\'s delight.

He told me some stories of his dating stories back in the time when he was still living in Korea. He said he went to psychic/fortune teller with his ex-girlfriend. The action of going to a fortune telling is called \"to do jeom.\" He said it is very popular among couples, and all his friends did it with their girlfriends. However, it is usually limited to adults, not teenage couples. 80% of people who go are just going for fun. Lee personally doesn\'t really believe in this kind of thing; however, he said his mom would go for sure if she thinks he is a serious relationship. The purpose of having fortune telling is to see if two people are suitable for each other.

He bought cake, present, and decorated the room. One of the key component for 100th day is the couple ring. The boyfriend has to buy a pair of couple rings and gifted one to the girl on the 100th day. The ring is supposely to be placed on the marriage finger. Lee and his girlfriend went to jewelry shop before the 100th day, and the girl picked up the ring she likes. Lee confessed that he spent a lot of money for celebrating the 100th day. He paid almost 800 USD for the ring itself (his girlfriend paid 10%) plus other expenses. \r\n\r\nOne interesting fact is that the boyfriend can ask around and collect money from his friends for buying the 100th day ring. He said the collecting is not only limited to close friends. He had asked all the people he knew at the time. He said his friend helped him out and he would definitively return the favor next time.\r\n\r\nRyan also showed his girlfriend\'s picture to his mom after they have celebrated 100th day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond celebration is the 200th day.

As a freshman, I couldn’t tell the difference between the juniors and seniors. It was only in the small group setting that I got to know a lot of about upperclassman. In group settings, like at general meetings on Thursdays, is when I saw the upperclassmen the most as an underclassman. I had a close relationship with Cho Yim, who was a fourth year when I was a first year. He discipled me. \r\n\r\nSK: What did the upperclassmen do for you when you were an underclassman? \r\nKH: They would take me out to eat a lot. If I needed class or drop advice, they would be more than willing to help. They also helped me in my Christian walk and showed that they cared by doing little things like making me care packages during finals week. \r\n\r\nSK: Did you do anything for upperclassmen?\r\nKH: I got a few of them care packages too. Usually I would swipe them at the dorms. At the end of the year, the first and second years would perform for the underclassman. When I was a sophomore, our class made videos showing appreciation for the seniors, saying how much we would miss them after they graduate. As a sophomore though, I just wish people took a bigger effort to get to know how I was doing. I understand they were busy, but it would have been nice to have some guidance during my sophomore year. \r\n\r\nSK: Now that you’re an upperclassman, what kind of relationship do you have with the underclassmen? \r\nKH: Honestly, I’ve gotten so much busier junior year. It’s hard to see the freshmen and sophomores, and it’s hard to meet up with them. I want to look after them, but not out of any kind of obligation. I have a small group and try to have one-on-ones with underclassmen, or people I’ve taken personal interest in. My apartment tries to host game nights at my apartment every once in a while. \r\n\r\nSK: Why?\r\nKH: Having those kinds of events helps the underclassmen get plugged into the ministry and meet other people. It’s a good way to get some interaction between underclassmen and upperclassmen. The last game night we had, we played mafia. That really gets people to talk to one another and see everyone’s true side. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you expect appreciation? \r\nKH: Not really. I’m not really doing the things I do for the underclassmen because I want to get something out of it.  \r\n\r\nSK: What do you do during one-on-ones? \r\nKH: We just got out to eat and talk. I get to see how they’re doing. I usually buy, but sometimes we’ll eat at the dorms and they’ll swipe me. \r\n\r\nSK: What do you do in fellowship? \r\nKH: After general meetings, KCM usually goes out for fellowship. We usually go out to eat and get food. It’s a good opportunity for upperclassmen and underclassmen to interact. People talk, joke, and fool around with each other. Nothing’s out of ill humor. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you see underclassmen as equals? Or more as younger brothers or sisters?\r\nKH: Since freshmen are younger, I feel like I have to take care of them.

When I was a sophomore, I usually was not pay for. Like in small group, sometimes our leader would pay for us and sometimes we would pay for ourselves. Usually they wouldn’t let me pay even though I wanted to pay. Sophomore year it changed. We paid for ourselves and freshmen. \r\n\r\nSK: What would you do for them? \r\nHO: Yeah, we would swipe them and sometimes I would cook for them at their apartment. \r\n\r\nSK: do you think it was unequal or about the same?\r\nHO: Overall, it was equal, but certain people it varied. People like Bryan, Christian, and Danny would come to the dorms a lot to eat with us, but we would hang out with them a lot too and they would take us places. \r\n \r\nSK: was it just bowling or eating? \r\nHO: We went out to shop like when Bryan would take us to century city mall. We went to KTOWN a lot to eat, and went to NRB. We went out to get Volcano a LOT too. And we went out to watch movies now and then. Mostly it was eating and bowling though, or doing nothing at their apartments. \r\n\r\nSK: what would you do at the apartments? \r\nHO: Chill, play cards, watch movies. \r\n\r\nSK: was there some kind of appreciation shown for them? \r\nHO: we have senior banquet every year for the seniors. We had deep talks every once in a while and I bought them boba every once in a while. \r\n\r\nSK: how would you show appreciation at organized events? \r\nHO: We wrote the seniors a song and performed for them at Senior Banquet. When you’re an underclassmen, you receive a lot, and eventually it’s your turn to give back. Even though you might not do things for them directly, eventually once you’re older, like if those relationships last, maybe you’ll buy them food every once in a while. It’s organized in a way that it’s the upperclassmen’s job to look after the underclassmen, and the underclassmen are babied..and later they pay it forward. That’s usually when people start trickling out as upperclassmen. \r\n\r\nSK: how do you usually pay it forward? \r\nHO: Starting sophomore year, it’s kind of on you to treat the freshmen the way you were treated. Buy freshmen food…take care of them. I think more than buying stuff, it’s kind of your responsibility to foster their growth. I think freshmen year there were those people who checked up on me spiritually and I grew a lot from that. After that, from what you learned, you share that with the underclassmen. But at the same time, you learn from them too. \r\n\r\nSK: What do you do as an upperclassman?\r\nHO: sometimes I get swiped, and do one-on-one, people don’t have time to go out to westwood and I don’t have a car. But when we go out for fellowships and I just meet up with people, I’ll buy for them. seeing how people are doing and how they’re adjusting to college and how they’re doing spiritually. I think, I wanted to be small group leader, but that’s given me more freedom to make relationships. \r\n\r\nSK: do you have favorites? \r\nHO: umm… I feel like inevitably I’m inclined to want to invest more in certain people, but that’s kind of logical and better even though ideally you shouldn’t want that…from a mentoring standpoint, you kind of have to  focus on certain people. i feel like, as leadership, there are certain people who would need it more..even if I don’t like them I feel like no one really invests in him, it’d be good to keep up with him. I’ve been trying to meet up with different people, and honing in on people I could relate with more, or my experiences would be more relevant to their growth. Of course I want to get to know everyone, but it’s hard..\r\n\r\nSK: do you kind of expect the same treatment? \r\nHO: not really…I think there’s a fine line. I don’t want to abuse them for swipes. Underclassmen always say that they have a lot of swipes..like Daniel ryu doesn’t have swipes, but I still want to meet up with him. I would still take him out and buy him food even though I know he can’t swipe me. They kind of feel like they SHOULD swipe because they’re getting taken care of. That’s like the only thing they can do. That’s the only way they can repay us, and I don’t let them pay for me.','hye-min interview.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',13717,1940019),(67,16,-1,67,'Class Interactions in Korean Campus Ministries','Audio','Name: Grace Kim \r\nYear: 3rd year, 20 years old\r\nMinistry: Crossroads Campus Ministries \r\n\r\nSK: Do you have a specific recollection or a significant interaction that you remember with an upperclassmen in your ministry? \r\nGK: In general, the upperclassmen reached out a lot.

CCM is where I found my core group of friends and people that I think are going to be my family for the rest of my life. People that I know that I will be in touch with later. Getting to know people from other years. Aside from just having fun, to build relationships and having people that you can trust and rely on, especially when it comes to spiritual walk as a Christian.

We would grow close enough for them to miss me and how much of good things they’ll say about me at senior banquet. \r\n\r\nSK: What is small group about? \r\nGK: In a lot of campus ministries, there are smaller size groups because it’s hard to get to know everyone in a ministry. A group of 3-4 girls led by a small group leader who is a year or two or three older. They meet every week and hey share and get to know each other better and on a deeper level as a sister or brother, helping each other with spiritual walks. \r\n\r\nSK: You’re a small group leader right now? \r\nGK: Yes. \r\n\r\nSK: What\'s your experience being a small group leader?\r\nGK: It’s hard. I thought it would be eaiser…all my girls are freshmen and on the quieter side. Personality-wise it’s not super easy..the effort has to be put into it. When we try to share, it’s a process because you have to build up that trust first. I’ve been trying to build up that trust because it’s hard because they’re not that close. Once a week is not enough…but as time goes by things are getting better. I try to buy them a couple times a quarter, but because I don’t have the means, I’ll try to mix things up when we meet. Sometimes we\'ll get dorm food or I’ll bring them to my apartment and we’ll go out to eat in Westwood and things like that. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you have any favorite underclassmen and how are you favoring them? \r\nGK: I have a couple favorites.

We would grow close enough for them to miss me and how much of good things they’ll say about me at senior banquet. \r\n\r\nSK: What is small group about? \r\nGK: In a lot of campus ministries, there are smaller size groups because it’s hard to get to know everyone in a ministry. A group of 3-4 girls led by a small group leader who is a year or two or three older. They meet every week and hey share and get to know each other better and on a deeper level as a sister or brother, helping each other with spiritual walks. \r\n\r\nSK: You’re a small group leader right now? \r\nGK: Yes. \r\n\r\nSK: What\'s your experience being a small group leader?\r\nGK: It’s hard. I thought it would be eaiser…all my girls are freshmen and on the quieter side. Personality-wise it’s not super easy..the effort has to be put into it. When we try to share, it’s a process because you have to build up that trust first. I’ve been trying to build up that trust because it’s hard because they’re not that close. Once a week is not enough…but as time goes by things are getting better. I try to buy them a couple times a quarter, but because I don’t have the means, I’ll try to mix things up when we meet. Sometimes we\'ll get dorm food or I’ll bring them to my apartment and we’ll go out to eat in Westwood and things like that. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you have any favorite underclassmen and how are you favoring them? \r\nGK: I have a couple favorites. There are personalities that click and personalities needed to work at. Not because they do something that wins me over, but it’s easier for me to talk to them. it’s not so hard to talk to them which is why I tend to like them better. \r\n','','',0,0),(69,16,-1,67,'DELETE','Audio','Name: Grace Kim \r\nYear: 3rd year, 20 years old\r\nMinistry: Crossroads Campus Ministries \r\n\r\nSK: Do you have a specific recollection or a significant interaction that you remember with an upperclassmen in your ministry? \r\nGK: In general, the upperclassmen reached out a lot. Definitely not all the upperclassmen, but there was a handful that were always reaching out to all the underclassmen. Asking us to eat, taking us out to just hang out to play. We wouldgo over their apartments to play games and they would take us bowling because they had cars. It helped a lot in our college experience because we were able to expand outside of the dorms and explore LA and try new things. \r\n\r\nSK: What exactly did you guys do when you hung out? \r\nWith the girls, they would take us out to eat and we would have girl talk and stuff. With the guys, it would be more about playing, going bowling. We went miniature golfing and played games at the apartments. \r\n\r\nSK: What do you guys usually talk about when you guys go out to eat? \r\nGK: Umm, just like getting to know each other was a big thing. \r\n\r\nSK:  would they help you out with stuff too?\r\nGK: I would definitely ask them because they were a lot more knowledgeable than I was. They had experience and went through things that I was going through. They were really helpful with good advice. \r\n\r\nSK: Did you as an underclassmen reciprocate towards the upperclassmen? Like, did you do stuff for them too? \r\nGK: I would swipe them, a lot. \r\n\r\nSK: Did that happen often? \r\nGK: Yeah. Used and abused my swipes, but I was happy to do it. I was glad when they asked me to swipe them, because they would always do so much for us. It was the least I could do for them. I felt kind of special that they would ask me for swipes than the other freshmen. \r\n\r\nSK: As an upperclassman, do you do the same things that they did with you? \r\nGK: Yes. I don’t have a car, so I’m limited. I’m a small group leader this year. I’ve been trying to eat and meet with underclassmen. It’s a lot harder than I thought because we’re far away and definitely we’re busier. I don’t go to fellowship all the time anymore. I have an obligation to reach out, and I do when I can. \r\n\r\nSK: What do you guys at fellowships? How is that run? \r\nGK: Fellowship is emphasized in CCM. Through fellowshipping with brothers and sisters you are able to build stronger relationships in college. CCM is where I found my core group of friends and people that I think are going to be my family for the rest of my life. People that I know that I will be in touch with later. Getting to know people from other years. Aside from just having fun, to build relationships and having people that you can trust and rely on, especially when it comes to spiritual walk as a Christian. So we would have fellowship every Thursday after our general meeting and we would try to have different events where people are given the opportunity to get to know everyone. \r\n\r\nSK: What\'s the upperclassmen and lowerclassmen interaction at fellowships? \r\nGK: I think it depends on the individual. There are some upperclassmen who are pretty close to underclassmen. There are other upperclassmen who just hang out with other upperclassmen. \r\n\r\nSK: With the eating out thing, who pays? \r\nFor every CCM event, freshmen don’t’ pay. Non-freshmen pay for the freshmen out of tradition. \r\n\r\nSK: Is there any way of showing appreciation or paying it forward? What was your role as an underclassman at Senior Banquet. \r\nGK: End of the year event for the seniors who are graduating. Each class pays tribute to the graduating class. It\'s tradition that the third year class plans banquet. One third year and one first year emcees. There are skits. The freshmen class has a performance offering tribute to the seniors and so do the second years. \r\n\r\nSK: What did you guys do as freshmen? \r\nGK: As freshmen we sang a song because we planned it very last minute, like the day of. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you expect the same treatment from lowerclassmen? \r\nGK: Yeah.

I would just go. But then I went to FA for the first time, but it was during midterm season for the first time. Stevo was our president and he treated us out to pizookie at BJ’s. It was my first significant recollection of having interaction with upperclassmen. \r\n\r\nSK: How did upperclassmen treat you?\r\nEL: When we went out for fellowship. I remember we went to Sak’s and we weren’t treated out…but I remember just being able to talk to Cho Yim and he was telling us different stories about him in the past years and trying to get to know us and sharing part of his life with us. I was really thankful that they just opened up really easily to us. They were really open to us even though they did not know us. \r\n\r\nSK: When you guys went out, who would usually do the buying?\r\nEL: Upperclassmen would usually. Seniors and sometimes juniors. \r\n\r\nWritten Notes-\r\n\r\nSK: As an underclassman, did you do anything for upperclassmen? \r\nEL: No, I didn’t really do anything. I occasionally swiped them at the dorms. We have something called Default Lunch, which is when Freshman Accountability leaders would set up times during the week for lunch at the dorms and upperclassmen came and ate with us. It was a good opportunity for fellowship. I remember it was every Thursday at Rendezvous. A fourth year named Ying Mo would come out all the time. There weren’t a lot of people, but it was nice to have that time to spend with them. \r\n\r\nSK: What do you do as an upperclassman?\r\nEL: Because I know how much upperclassmen reached out to us like through asking us how we were doing when we met up for Monday night prayer, it made me want to do that. I feel like I’m more pouring myself out there. With small group, I take them out to eat, cook for them at my apartment, make them care packages on Valentines day…I made stuff for them and try to be involved with how they are spiritually, how their church and ministry experience is going, praying for them. Now I can help as an upperclassman in whatever situation they’re in with the experience that I have. I give them advice for school and tips for coping with college life too. \r\n\r\nSK: Were you in a small group as an underclassman? How was that for you?\r\nEL: It was really good. I didn’t realize how much small group leaders did a lot for us until second year and now, now that I’m a small group leader My small group leader was probably really busy, but she still made time for us and always was there for us and tried to reach out as much as possible. It’s a time commitment and a monetary commitment, but it’s pretty awesome to see how much the upperclassmen loved us and committed their time and effort to reach out to underclassmen. \r\n\r\nSK: Did you ever feel used for swipes? \r\nEL: I don’t think so, because they were genuine with how they asked about our lives. I gained more from them than they gave to me. As an underclassman, I didn’t realize it as much. But now that I’m an upperclassman, I’m trying to treat the underclassmen in the same way as the upperclassmen treated me. it shows how much more they tried. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you guys interact more on an individual level or a group level?\r\nEL: I guess it’s mixed. It’s mixed because you could see how they baby us in general and then there are those individual interactions as well. It’s not like all of them have deeper relationships with all of us, but individual relationships formed through facebook or freshman accountability. We really saw their love in their interactions with us. \r\n\r\nSK: As an upperclassman, do you have favorites? \r\nEL: I’m not going to lie, I think I have favorites. It’s because I felt more connected to the first underclassmen I met. You just feel more connected to them. I realized that when underclassmen respond more to your acts for them, you tend to favor them a little more. I think that’s inevitable. We all have that desire to have feelings returned. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you look after them more? \r\nEL: I don’t do anything overly special for them, but the connection is unique. I end up having more one-on-one times with them, even if it’s small talk. \r\n\r\nSK: What happens at general meeting on Thursdays?\r\nEL: There are a lot of interactions before and after general meeting. It’s not like we can see each other every day. Those times are some of the few times upperclassmen and underclassmen can interact as a whole. For sure you will see upperclassmen and lowerclassmen. Being able to catch up with one another, there’s a lot of small talk going on during those times. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you enjoy these interactions? \r\nEL: Yes! Definitely. \r\n\r\nSK: What happens at fellowship? \r\nEL: KCM mostly goes out to eat for fellowship. That way, when conversation gets awkward, you can just eat the food! We’ve had freshman accountability and upperclassman accountability. There was a BYOB – Bring your own Bible Day. We also have a Jeopardy tournament once a year. We’ve gone broomballing and had scavenger hunts. We have a UCLA/USC night and a KCCCM night, where KCM, CCM, and KCCC get together. A lot of bonding happens during these events.  \r\n\r\nSK: Do you expect the same treatment? \r\nEL: I think I don’t.

Um, and my church we had a program in the summer like every year for Ukraine and I thought it’d be great to go to. \r\nGK: So, explain what a training process entails. What kind of activities you guys had to do like to prepare before you went on, actually went on.\r\nDL: Before we went, we did body worship, we did skits, just preparing all things for the people we were going to perform for. The program at Ukraine was very interesting cuz it wasn’t a typical mission that we went there to a church program there and um, so we basically our target weren’t non-believers, they were actually believers part of the church and uh, so basically we did much less of evangelizing but much more of being there for them and uh facilitating certain things. And uh so I guess training wise before we went it was very basic stuff…entertainment I guess. \r\nGK: Like…can you be as specific as possible?\r\nDL: We didn’t meet every weekend…we met I think, there was every weekend of practice for just mission teams in general cause our church had a program for India and Myanmar as well as Ukraine. But, um I personally couldn’t make many of them. We had like intensive something called a Heaven week and during heaven week we did a lot of prep just making sure we had all the body worship and skits down.\r\nGK: And then, did you guys have like…um, other than like preparing for things other than body worship and skits, did you guys do other things?\r\nDL: Other than body worship and skits…um, ‘cause our group consisted of not just college students but also a group of adults and they brought a bunch of supplies for the missionaries, the long-term missionaries that lived there with the people. And uh…for us, as college students, we didn’t really do much with that but it is something that our team also did.\r\nGK: Do you think then that training was very helpful?\r\nDL: Um, yea of course training was helpful. I mean without the training we wouldn’t have been able to do the body worship and things.\r\nGK: Okay, um so how was your team like? Like what were the dynamics and kind of your interaction with each team member?\r\nDL: Our team was 3 girls and 3 guys, 1 junior or well, I guess since I went in 2010, 2 of them were my grade and 1 of them was a grade below and 1 was a grade above. Dynamics I guess I knew the college people better cuz we knew each other from before. So it wasn’t much of a transition. Dynamics…we didn’t have any huge conflict or anything uh during the trip. I think everything else was pretty smooth.\r\nGK: Did you guys do things like team building exercises and stuff with them? Or no\r\nDL: We actually, it was very interesting because our team leader,  he’s like a bodybuilder and he was like hiking all the time and hiking and like rock-climbing and so he made our team building exercises into like rock-climbing. It was actually really fun and we went rock climbing once…and yeah.\r\nGK: What was your role in the team?\r\nDL: Um, I guess my role in the team was I guess the same as everyone…just to I guess mostly to show them love because it’s not like we could, it wasn’t a mission trip where we proclaimed the word of God. It wasn’t like that. In that way, it was very different from the typical mission trip than I would’ve expected, but uh, just to be there. It was almost like a retreat setting the church and just to be there and interact with them. There was definitely a language barrier but there were people that could translate from English to Ukrainian which is a derivative of Russian. It was really cool because I ended up learning the Russian alphabet too and it was…I guess mainly just to show love to them and be there for them to talk to and be their friend. \r\nGK: What were your feelings leading up to this point of the training process, like right before you left?\r\nDL: Before I left I was really excited…I had been on missions before to Mexico but I expected something completely different because it was my first overseas I guess um, and yea\r\nGK: So how did you prepare funds for the trip?\r\nDL: Um, I…we did a couple things. One thing we had like fundraisers at our church like café night for missions. Also there was uh, writing letters to people that would be willing to support. I just created a group on facebook: support David to go to Ukraine and then whoever responded then I would send them a missions letter or a support letter.\r\nGK: So, can you describe like a typical day at missions like overseas.\r\nDL: At Ukraine, I wouldn’t say it was typical missions. It was really interesting because the first day we were there, we spent at..we went to Kiev which is downtown and it’s not that bad there. We actually got this place that was super nice. The pastor there found a place for us and it was like so luxurious. And then we went to..we went on like 10 hour bus ride or something to Odesa and that’s like more rural area. It’s kind at the corner of Ukraine. So once we got there, that was their retreat site. It’s kinda like a camp. When we got there, it was really hot and really humid.\r\nA typical day, we would get up around 8 or 9 and eat breakfast with everyone. And, we would do morning exercises with everyone. And uh, there would be a sermon during uh I think before lunch and we would have lunch and they would have some kind of discussion time slash some program. One time we had like uh prepare a skit or something like that. And then we had dinner and another sermon after dinner and just hang out, go to sleep. Definitely a lot of free time, opportunity to talk to people there. \r\nGK: What kind of people did you interact with? There were like the Korean missionaries there? \r\nDL: Mostly, yeah, there were like mostly Korean missionaries.\r\nGK: And would you interact with the natives there too?\r\nDL: Uh-huh. \r\nGK: How would you interact with them? Talk to them or just perform in front of them?\r\nDL: Hello! Like just say hi. Um, yea…it was just very casual just as if I would meet a friend, “hello,” just have a conversation.\r\nGK: Did you have stuff like small groups or accountability partners, EV partners or stuff like that.\r\nDL: No, as I said it was very not about EV. It was really just bout talking to them.\r\nGK: So you didn’t have that within your own mission team?\r\nDL: Within my own mission team, no.\r\nGK: If you could say like one of the hardest part of missions, what would it be?\r\nDL: The hardest part of my missions trip experience was…mm it was definitely uncomfortable to be in a different setting, in a totally different country. But I mean I guess I’m just spoiled in California. Um, I think the hardest thing for me though was because I expected a mission trip where I had certain expectations that it would be really tough and it would be a time of just stretching and uh, yea and when I went there, it was more like retreat, it was more like fun. I felt like almost like I didn’t go on a mission trip per se. It was more like a retreat, that was kind of tough to see what kind of impact I was making.\r\nGK: How did you already have like this conception of what a mission trip would be like? Was it because you heard other people’s stories?\r\nDL: I mean there are…yea I guess other people’s stories from what I’ve kind of seen other people testify. \r\nGK: What was the easiest part of your mission trip?\r\nDL: The easiest part was uh, I guess I mean people are really friendly so it was really easy to just uh talking and getting to know them and stuff. A lot easier than I thought it would be because language barrier wasn’t as bad because they were so willing to…\r\nGK: So how did you feel after the trip was over?\r\nDL: As I said, it was a little bit, ah what do I do. I just spent 2 weeks abroad thinking I’m doing God’s work and all this preconceptions of missions. So when I came back it was humbling. God was saying I don’t work under your conception, I don’t work under you belief or what you expect but it’s about what I need and what I want you to do.\r\nGK: Did the mission experience just end for you once you came back to America? And if not, what kinds of things did you have to engage in and stuff.\r\nDL: Um, I guess yea when I came back it was just yea, it was over. We did some missions debrief and we were the first missions program abroad so when we came back, we also had India and Myanmar team that were gonna leave in like a week or 2 and we helped them with skits and…that was really a good time too. But, aside from that, it was like went to missions, came back. \r\nGK: Um, if you could take one thing from the experience what would it be?\r\nDL: One thing? I guess, would be that like really God doesn’t have limitations on things like he doesn’t follow my little box I put him in like he really does work in crazy ways that I wouldn’t expect even by just being there I didn’t do that much but he called me out for that.\r\nGK: Would you go on missions again? Why or why not?\r\nDL: Yea, I mean it was a good experience, to be out of my comfort zone a little bit and to meet new people and see how the world really isn’t the way it is here. \r\nGK: Okay cool, thank you very much!\r\n','DLim.wma','audio/x-ms-wma',15001579,1622645),(72,7,86,21,'Test','Images','Some images','','',0,0),(73,7,-1,NULL,'tt','Fieldnotes','asfd','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1241739),(74,7,-1,NULL,'tt2','Images','sdf','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1244213),(75,7,-1,NULL,'tt3','Images','tt3','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1244394),(76,10,-1,NULL,'DELETE makkoli among the halmang',NULL,'','','',0,0),(77,7,-1,NULL,'tt4',NULL,'','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1244506),(78,7,-1,NULL,'tt5',NULL,'','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1244588),(79,7,-1,NULL,'tt6',NULL,'','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1245017),(80,7,-1,NULL,'Upload Test',NULL,'','moodle_vs_claroline.pdf','application/pdf',944271,1247064),(81,27,68,58,'Korean-American Experience with Hallyu Wave 1','Fieldnotes','T: What was your first experience with Korean pop culture?\r\n\r\nD: When I was younger, my parents used to borrow video tapes of dramas from a Korean video rental store. Also, my older sister used to borrow video tapes of Korean music shows so I would just sit and watch with them.\r\n\r\nT: How old were you at this time? \r\n\r\nD: Probably about seven or eight years old.\r\n\r\nT: Did you understand what was happening in the dramas and music shows?\r\n\r\nD: I\'m not exactly sure. I think I was too young to remember.\r\n\r\nT: Did you have a lot of Korean friends while growing up?\r\n\r\nD: Well, I grew up in a predominately upper-middle class white community. Growing up I was always the only non caucasian child out of all of my school friends. I did have some Korean-American friends though, but they were all from my church.\r\n\r\nT: Did you speak Korean with your Korean-American friends and were they interested in Korean pop culture? \r\n\r\nD: No, none of us really grew up speaking a lot of Korean and hated going to Korean Language School. I don\'t think any of us were very good at reading, writing, or even speaking Korean, so we ended up only speaking English growing up. It was pretty bad, most of the time we would freeze up if adults would ask us something in Korean. Since we didn\'t really understand a lot of Korean, none of us watched dramas or listened to Korean music or any of that pop culture stuff. The closest we ever got to Korean pop culture was listening to our parents speak Korean or eating Korean food that our moms made us.\r\n\r\nT: Then what was your first encounter with Korean music or dramas? \r\n\r\nD: When I was in high school I met new friend my sophmore year. She was born and raised in Korea until she came to the US in middle school. She only listened to Korean music and watched Korean dramas and she was just I guess really in tune with the culture she grew up in. At that time I hadn\'t listened to any Korean music or watched any dramas since I was really young. Growing up I only listened to American music and watched American TV shows. Looking back at it now, its really interesting how we became friends considering the fact that we had veryyyy little in common. As we became closer friends, I guess in a way her \"Koreanness\" rubbed off on me and my \"Americanness\" rubbed off on her. I would have to say that my interest in Korean pop culture all started with her introducing me to Big Bang and the Wonder Girls. I think the first drama (with subtitles of course) that I watched at that time was Full House. \r\n\r\nT: So how did your interest in that develop?\r\n\r\nD: I guess it just kept going on from there. After watching Full House, I started watching another drama called My Girl, and then another called Kwe-gul Choonhyang and so on. With music I went from only listening to Big Bang and Wonder Girls but my friend started introducing me to other groups so I started listening to other idol groups like Super Junior, DBSK, 2PM, and 2ne1. Now I listen to a more broad range of Korean music like Korean Hip-Hop, rap, and ballad styles. \r\n\r\nT: I find that really interesting because I remember you telling me that you didn\'t use a lot of Korean growing up. How did that change?\r\n\r\nD: Well, I guess the more Korean music I listened to and Korean dramas I watched, the more I learned? Its really funny because my parents noticed a big difference in me as well. They would make fun of me because growing up I hated being Asian even to the point where I hated when my parents would speak Korean to me, but now I speak mostly Korean to my parents. Its interesting how things turned out I guess. My parents have noticed how much my Korean had improved.\r\n\r\nT: Do you identify yourself as strictly American or Korean? Or would you say that you are Korean-American?\r\n\r\nD: Its funny that you ask this question because I recently talked to some of my other Korean friends who were born here about this topic. Honestly, I\'m not exactly sure. A couple of my friends that grew up in mostly non-Asian and even majority Asian communities said that they felt very out of place while growing up because either they looked different or even though they were born here their parents raised them with their Korean culture and traditions. At times like these they said they felt like they would identify themselves as Korean and the same goes for me. \r\n\r\nT: So none of them identified themselves (including you) as American? \r\n\r\nD: They did but heres the thing, if you were to have asked me this question maybe 6 or seven years ago when I was in my early teens I would have said I would identify myself as just strictly American but a lot has changed since then. Now I honestly feel like Korean-Americans identify with their own \"Korean-American\" culture. My friends have told me that when they travel to Korea to visit family or even just for leisure they feel very out of place even though they look the same and have the same ethnic background, since they were brought up in the US there were a lot of cultural differences and misunderstandings. \r\n\r\nT: How about you? Have you ever experienced that before?\r\n\r\nD: Yeah the same goes for me.

Do you like Kimchi? How many Kimchi have you eaten? What was your favorite one?\r\nM(Minsoo): Hi, Of course I love Kimchi. I can’t image that I have a meal without Kimchi especially when I eat Korean Food. Since I was young, I have grown up by eating Kimchi, I think I had at least over 15 kinds of Kimchi. (Baechu kimchi, GGak du gi, GGo deul bbae gi, mu mal rang ee, and so on) I am from south part of Korea, so I like much spicy and salty one rather than regular. Among many kinds of Kimchi, GGo deul bbae gi is my favorite kimchi.\r\nC: Oh, I have a question. You said you came from south part of Korea, and that is reason for you like much spicy and salty Kimchi. What is that mean?\r\nM: Alright, in Korea, we have some different kinds of Kimchi depends on where is the Kimchi made. In South-west part (Jeon ra do), they have many kinds of Kimchi than other part, and the taste is much like mild. As I said, I am from the South-east part(Kyeong sang do), we prefer much like salty and spicy one than other part.\r\nC: So you said you eat Kimchi everyday huh?\r\nM: Yes, actually I don’t eat Kimchi every day since I came to US. But I can say I eat Kimchi at least 5 days in a week. In Korea history, traditionally, Kimchi is important for Korean food. Kimchi is very healthy food. Kimchi prevents cancer, and helps to keep up immunity so that our body can beat some virus or bacteria easily. Also Kimchi makes our body works well because of ingredient of Kimchi such as garlic. Not only the Kimchi is good healthy food, but also Kimchi has a long history same as Korean history. \r\nC: Do you know how to make Kimchi? I think you know how to make Kimchi because you love Kimchi.\r\nM: Oh actually, I never have the experience to make kimchi, but I saw my mother makes Kimchi. First, you have to wash the cabbage that you will make with, with salt. And you need to make some source to add up to the cabbage. This source makes a different taste of Kimchi. In my memory, my mother put some chili powder, pickled shrimps or clams, garlic, and salt. You also can put some oyster or radish for your choice. Last you need to mix up with the cabbage and the source. \r\nC: Oh, I see. The steps to make Kimchi sound not that simple.\r\nM: Yeah.  It is not easy steps and there are many kinds of way to make Kimchi. The Kimchi from market is not that good as much as my mother’s one. I miss so much my mother’s Kimchi.\r\nC: Haha~ you should. Last question! I saw the menu from Korean restaurant that Kimchi fried rice. What is that?\r\nM: Oh, we eat Kimchi as Kimchi itself, also we make some foods with Kimchi too. For example, we make Kimchi- JJige. It is kind of stew with Kimchi. And as you said, we make fried rice with Kimchi too. And we make a kind of pancake with Kimchi too.

Both of my small group leaders were third years when I was a freshman. Both of them didn’t follow the normal rules, or they didn’t follow the usual routine structure of small groups. They were usually open, and asked me what was going on in my life. I remember we used to eat out and hang out a lot. \r\n\r\nSK: What was the format of small groups for KCM and CCM? \r\nBL: I was in a small group with two other freshmen. With KCM, my small group leader usually asked me how my week was, if there was anything significant on my mind. We went out a lot, but my small group leader would ask to meet up with me randomly throughout my week. With CCM, my small group leader was always finding new ways to do small group. He would give us personality tests or spiritual gift tests. In CCM small group we had a workbook called Foundations of Faith, and my small group leader would think of applications we could do in our lives from it. \r\n\r\nSK: When you guys went out, who usually bought the food? \r\nBL: The small group leader bought food for us most of the time. It felt weird that they would pay, but they would always say, “Pay us back by doing the same for the underclassmen when you’re an upperclassmen.” \r\n\r\nSK: Do you treat the freshmen the same? \r\nBL: I try to. I didn’t have much opportunity because I haven’t been out to CCM in a while. When I do go to fellowships though, I try to buy for freshmen or people who don’t have money on them to buy food. \r\n\r\nSK: Did the upperclassmen take care of you? \r\nBL: Always. They always wanted to know how I was doing, and asked me if I had any prayer requests. I felt special when they went out of their way during general meetings or randomly to talk to me. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you think you’ll be a small group leader next year? \r\nBL: Yeah, if God calls me to it. I want to have the same heart and attitude towards my guys as my small group leaders had towards me. I have that example to look back to. I want to take them out places and hang out with them. \r\n\r\nSK: What did you guys do when you hung out as CCM as a whole?  \r\nBL: We would go to Koreatown and play pool. We ate most of the time. We would go to the movies once in a while. I would almost always be paid for. \r\n\r\nSK: How would an upperclassman react if you said no? \r\nBL: I would argue with them, and insist that I could pay. Most of the underclassmen would be willing to be paid for. Who wouldn’t? I just didn’t feel comfortable being paid for all the time. \r\n\r\nSK: How do you reciprocate towards upperclassmen? \r\nBL: I help out the underclassmen for that reason that my small group leaders looked out for me. They were offering themselves out of generosity, not out of expecting that they would get something back. Through my small group leaders, I realized how clueless I was about a lot of things. I want to help out the freshman in the best way that I can. I gave class advice to Sharline when she asked me about chem course since I took a lot of them my freshman year. James asked me about chemical engineering and where to get old tests. \r\n\r\nSK: How do you and the freshmen interact?\r\nBL: It’s kind of awkward with some of them. If I have similar interests with them, like Audrey and I both like dance, we connect really well. I am more willing to talk to them just because there is more to talk about. At the beginning of the year, the sophomore class and the freshman class played a lot of games at someone’s dorm room. We would play pretty late into the night, too. Now I study with them when I can at Covel or at a lounge somewhere. I eat with some of them once in a while. Freshmen are eccentric, but fun to be around. \r\n\r\nSK: Did you ever feel used and abused as a freshman?\r\nBL: Nope. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you have any favorites among the freshmen? \r\nBL: I mean, there are people I connect with better, but no.

The seniors all had cars, so they would always take us places. They were really nice about rides too. If underclassman needed a ride to volunteering or an interview, seniors would usually gladly take him or her there. I remember one time we went bowling three days in a row…that was tiring. The guys were the ones who would take us out, but the girls were the ones who would be the “moms” of CCM. Like when we went to Mammoth for a snowboarding trip, they would be the ones cooking the meals. It was always fun to hang out with them, but sometimes it was mostly fun and games, rather than looking for those deeper relationships. \r\n\r\nSK: Would you reciprocate as underclassmen in any way?\r\nEP: We would swipe them a lot. During finals season, the upperclassmen would come to the dorms to study late at night, so we would usually swipe them Bruin Café or something. Umm…during senior banquet I guess we showed our appreciation for everything the upperclassmen did for us. Our freshman year we made a song and sang it for them on stage. \r\n\r\nSK: Were you in a small group? \r\nEP: Yeah. Usually, freshmen have a small group leader who is a third year, but I had a senior. She had a car so every week she would take us out to places in LA to eat. It must have cost her a lot of money… \r\n\r\nSK: Who paid usually? \r\nEP: She would always pay. And my other small group member and I felt that she wouldn’t let us pay even if we asked. The experience with small group was kind of different with my second year small group leader, who was also a fourth year. Every few times we went out to eat, she would ask us to pay for ourselves. But she would make us care packages before finals and bring us boba. \r\n\r\nSK: Where would you guys go for small group usually? \r\nEP: Both of my small group leaders had cars, so they would take us out to Koreatown and buy us dinner or take us to a café to get dessert. I feel like my library of good places to eat around the LA area expanded. \r\n\r\nSK: Were you close to your small group leaders? \r\nEP: Umm…I wasn’t that close to my first year small group leader. She was a senior so she was really busy with classes and work. She would take us out to eat all the time but that was about it. There wasn’t really a deeper connection than the meetings that we had every week. And after she graduated, we never came into contact again. With my second year small group leader, she comes over to my apartment sometimes and checks up on how I’m doing. \r\n\r\nSK: Now that you’re an upperclassman, do you interact with the underclassmen in the same way?\r\nEP: I try to. I didn’t know that junior year was going to be so busy. Whenever I have free time, I try to catch lunch or dinner at the dorms with the underclassmen to see how they’re holding up, and how their spiritual walk is at that moment. I don’t have a car, so I can’t take them out anywhere, but I pay for them whenever we go out to fellowships. Those are ideal times when underclassmen and upperclassmen can interact. The freshmen this year seem to bond really well with upperclassmen. The upperclassmen and underclassman guys bond really well over sports, like when there’s IM football or soccer. The girls usually do more one-one-one meetings. \r\n\r\nSK: Are there any interactions between you and underclassmen outside of the CCM setting? \r\nEP: Occasionally! If there are a cluster of people from the same city, they usually hang out during breaks. I’m from the Glendale area, and one time during winter break Glendale people got together to go watch a movie. Other times people visit other people in other cities. \r\n\r\nSK: Are you a small group leader yourself? Why? \r\nEP: I’m currently a small group leader. I have three freshman girls. I received a lot of love when I was an underclassmen, and I remember the little things my small group leaders use to do for me. I just thought it would be nice to have freshmen experience the same thing and be able to look back at good memories. \r\n\r\nSK: What do you do for them? \r\nEP: Well, I don’t have a car, so I can’t take them out to Koreatown, sadly. I take them out to places in Westwood. Even I haven’t been to a lot of places in Westwood so we explore together. I usually pay for food, but occasionally they would pay for their own food and I would pay for dessert or something. Sometimes I bring them over to the apartment and cook for them. We go over a workbook called Foundations of Faith, so I kind of teach them from it during small group meetings. I really want them to have a good experience with small group so that they know how to treat their small groups if they become leaders later. \r\n\r\nSK: Do you have favorites with the underclassmen? \r\nEP: No…not really. I try to make an effort to interact with as many underclassmen as possible. With a ministry of a hundred plus people though, it’s hard to get to know everyone better so I think I resort to spending more time with certain people to establish an ongoing connection.

Explain what motivated your decision to go overseas.\r\nSK: Well, I wasn’t really, I didn’t have summer school or anything, um and like one of my team leaders from like another mission trip asked if I was going and I said I wasn’t really thinking about it and I just decided to go. \r\nGK: Okay, um so then, after you decided to go, uh what was the training process like. What did that entail?\r\nSK: Uh so maybe for like a month or two, we met every Sunday for a couple of hours and we kind of got acquainted with um I guess with the country itself and we did like research on it and um we kinda talked about itinerary like what we’re gonna do there. We got information about our ministries and um and our leaders they gave us like um quizzes and stuff to I guess test our knowledge on what we learned um. And then like maybe like two weeks before we had like intense training sessions like every day from like 6am to  6pm and that was the time when we learned like…that’s an exaggeration but um we learned like the skits and like the body worship and that’s when we learned like mostly memorized everything. \r\nGK: Do you think, what do you think is the purpose of those skits and body worships?\r\nSK: What do I think is the, oh um…oh the skits and the body worship? Um, since like we’re going to a country where they don’t really speak English, it’s kind of a way to communicate like what what message we’re trying to convey to them without like having to struggle through the language barrier so like so hopefully through our body worship they can see like what we’re about and then what we’re like representing I guess? \r\nGK: Okay, um…so who and how was your team. It’s dynamics and your interactions with other members.\r\nSK: Oh, so we were in a team of 10 people, from our church and then there was the missionary’s wife and his 2 kids and we were with them like everywhere. Um, team dynamic it was really not really diverse but the majority of us are college students and then our two team leaders were out of college and then our pastor was way out of college, he was a pastor. And team dynamic, like there wasn’t a lot of conflict. And I think everyone got along and kinda got closer as a team as the mission went on. And um, and that’s it.\r\nGK: Okay um so then what is the role of the team leader?\r\nSK: Well, they kinda did all the…um team leader did like all the administrative stuff. So the team leader were the ones that like you know bought the tickets and planned the itinerary and they kind of planned everything um uh, yeah I mean we just kind of follow them wherever. And oh well there were team leaders that did all the mission stuff and then our pastor was like the spiritual leader so then he was the one that kept us accountable and sat us down to debrief every day. Yea…\r\nGK: And what was your role on the team?\r\nSK: What was my role?\r\nGK: Mm.\r\nSK: Faithful team member, Like just cooperate and follow directions and also like a role, I mean everyone’s role in general was to like be in prayer and like kind of not cause trouble for like the missionary and like not be a burden to the team and like just cooperate well.\r\nGK: Mm. What were your feelings leading up to this point of the training process, like before you left. \r\nSK: Oh, um I was excited? I was um…I don’t know I was just excited to like go cause again on missions and kind of, cause part of missions you kind of like see like this whole new kind of world and you just anticipate that and you kind of willing to like see the world in another perspective again rather than just staying and like oh, this is India blah blah blah just like really see what it’s like and yeah just see what God is doing in India too like through the missionaries there. \r\nGK: Uh, how did you prepare funds for the trip.\r\nSK: Okay, so funds. There was this whole process where I had to write a support letter um like informing people on where I was going for how long and like why I wanted to go and then basically I was asking at the end of the letter for like prayer and like if they could provide financial assistance than um they were given that option. And then um, yeah and then I would include like an envelope and a stamp on it and they would just send me like whatever checks or cash or whatever and I also included like a small postcard for like any prayer requests they had so I could pray for them while I was on the mission trip. Um, that’s not part of my answer though but uh but yeah I mean but yeah I mean you won’t like even when I went to Cambodia it was like oh my gosh how am I gonna fund and all like how am I gonna like yeah it’s all gonna work out and like at the last minute at like the last month or so it would just like work out and it’s like oh. \r\nGK: Okay. How was the lifestyle different in India than in America?\r\nSK: How was the lifestyle different? How was the lifestyle in India?\r\nGK: Mm.\r\nSK: Uh, Well we spent most of our time in Northeast India and it’s not like the mainland so we were in more like wider, greener portion of India and people were like in a very mountainous area and the majority of them were Buddhist and um, yeah like the people they had cars and stuff and they walked around a lot too it was very like agrarian society. Um, uh yeah\r\nGK: Okay, well what did you do while you were on missions like specifically what did you guys do and what was your approach to like missions and stuff?\r\nSK: Okay, so we stayed at like uh one of the leader’s houses- while the leader of like…the church and we just stayed there and we went out to like villages and then we would do kinda  like VBS stuff like vacation bible school stuff and then we made crafts and we um did body worship and skits for them, um we played with kids and…yeah oh we went to a school once. Well yea, we went to a school once and oh yeah, we went to a school and taught English and kind of like taught them kind of like a bible study thing and um the missionaries would like prepare food for the villagers there and what did you say,  the approach?\r\nGK: Mhm.\r\nSK: Like what do you mean, like the approach?\r\nGK: Like what was the approach to like cause you know the purpose is to like share the gospel so then what is the approach to then achieving that.\r\nSK: Oh! Um, well I think rather than just explicitly telling them the gospel just cause there as that language barrier, like I said before like the skits and the body worship were mostly done because…communication and like I guess um our service to them as like you know like kids or like taking care of them of them and like having these little like um VBS kind of things like if they were to look at what craft they made or like a few years down kind of like remember, oh yea they came like even from that if they could see the purpose of like why we came like um yeah just for like pray for them too. Um uh, cause yea it’s just kinda like weird or like amazing how like they have like a large Buddhist community and like people converted to Christianity and like converted against the grain and like they’re telling their own people about the gospel and like kind of reaching out to like these religions and stuff and we’re just kind of like helping them, kind of like facilitating them to do that so we weren’t like the forefront but we were like supporting. \r\nGK: Um, so then lets see, explain like a daily ritual, like a typical day on the missions field.\r\nSK: Okay, uh so let’s see. Cause we did something different every day. So usually we just get up in the morning and eat breakfast cause they would make us breakfast—\r\nGK: Like the missionaries?\r\nSK: No no no, by the owner of the house? And then they would tell us what we’re doing for the day like the missionary will tell us like oh we’re going to this village oh we’re having um, oh we’re going to a Buddhist temple to kind of like see what it’s like there and see how they worship and see how like what they believe in and stuff. And then, either do the VBS thing or kind of like walk around and go around the area, um and yea do crafts and blah blah blah. And then we come back, debrief, eat dinner, and then yea, and then team members would kind of have like their own time at night and maybe they can talk to each other and talk to the leaders there and go to sleep and then yeah. \r\nGK: What was the most memorable thing about missions?\r\nSK: The most memorable? Um, like you want a specific event or like..?\r\nGK: Anything.\r\nSK: Anything? Okay um…I think the most memorable...I think that place in general, the place we went, was a very obscure place and I don’t think anyone would think of going there other than for like ultimate hikers or travelers or whatever. But then like um, to see how we were able to go there and meet the people there and see how God is working there through that very minority few people that actually accepted Jesus and they were actually starting ministry there and see how God could even reach even the most like you don’t even know where that is um and…\r\nGK: Did you guys have like small group or accountability partners or EV partners or stuff like that?\r\nSK: Oh, we had EV partners. So guys and girls were paired up by partners and uh we didn’t actually do straight up EV I don’t think but it was kind of more like oh where’s your EV partner like where are they like check where they are kind of like and the guys would kind of be protective or whatever and be kind of like the brawn I guess like if there were any like tough terrain to go through they would like help the girls.\r\nGK: Um, and how was the team interaction at this point of your trip.\r\nSK: Uh it was generally good but I think we were all really tired because we were doing ministry stuff every day and we were walking around a lot and stuff. I think it kind of got on people’s nerves a little bit ‘cause you know everyone is exhausted and like especially when we’re like in the mainland we couldn’t catch our flight and we were stuck in these cars with these shady taxi drivers that didn’t like uh! But I think yea we got on each other’s nerves then like everyone was frustrated and tired and just wanted to go home and stuff like that. So I think there was that one moment but I think in general there wasn’t like no huge conflict. \r\nGK: Mkay. Um, what were some specific challenges you had to face both personal or externally. \r\nSK: Um, I think physically I’m not really used to, I don’t really like physical discomfort so when it came to like we had to carry like our bags around we had to carry like everything we had with like all the time. There was a lot of stuff you know! So I would tend to feel like really weary with that kind of stuff so um, and kind of struggling not to like pity them and not be like oh you’re so unfortunate and I’m here to make things better because that’s not like how it is you know like we’re equals and like we’re sharing the gospel with them and that doesn’t make us like any better or like any less privileged than we are. And like just to not like keep that in India keep whatever I experienced in India because yeah that’s like a memory but that’s something has to translate into life here. Um, yeah. \r\nGK: Um, now how did you feel after the trip was over?\r\nSK: How did I feel after the trip was over? Uhh, mm I was enlightened I guess? Obviously tired, but it kind of gave me like new perspective, more stuff to chew on um more stuff to pray for I guess and mm yeah. \r\nGK: Mm…um so then did the missions experience once you came back to America? And if not, then what other kinds of things did you have to do. \r\nSK: Oh, well our team had to meet up for debriefing sessions every few months so we like get together and like eat and reminisce and check up on how each other’s doing ‘cause like we’re all from different places like different colleges and stuff so those few times that we eat together and like remember it brings everything back. Um, yeah, like sadly I think like cause the leaders over there, they had like 2 daughters and they were like around our age and we like got close to them and would talk to them and be like oh yea, we’ll keep in contact and stuff like that and I think I did for like a couple months but like…yea we’re like facebook friends but we don’t like really talk anymore, kind of sad.\r\nGK: How did uh…let’s see. If you could take one thing from your experience, what would it be? \r\nSK: If I could take one thing? Um…mm…kind of not to not to be discouraged by just like the conditions here like the darkness I guess I would say like because even in a place like India where it’s like Hinduism is like you know engrained in like the history and culture and like to see how God is using like those few people like missionaries you know like missionaries risk their lives you know they’re like in hiding just to spread to gospel but then just to see they’re like little works of light in such a huge country um kind of gives hope I guess for situations here it seems like people are apathetic or like there’s crap going around here too you know but and like God is still working in that.\r\nGK: Would you go overseas again for missions? Why or why not?\r\nSK: Definitely! Um, why? Cause it’s kind of like I said before kind of just want to see how God is working in different places and like kind of just to meet you know all different races and cultures and how God is working in their lives too. And to kind of just see how missionaries are like doing their thing and how they do their thing like every day. Um…yeah. \r\nGK: Okay, that’s it.

J = Josh Kang\r\n\r\nH: How would you rate your level of Korean pride?\r\nJ: Pride in the country of Korea or the Wonder Girls Korea or the culture?\r\nH: Both. The country Korea?\r\nJ: 6/7\r\nH: The culture of Korea?\r\nJ: The pre-1988 Korea would be 8 or 9. The Wonder Girls Korea would be 4. In general, I hate fobs. I don\'t mean just immigrants. I mean 낙하산 kids (\"Parachute\" kids) who come from money, who are spoiled, who are dropped of in America to learn English and exploit American resources, who come and treat America like their playground.\r\nH: Why do they come to exploit our resources?\r\nJ: They come because America is great. THere are resources to exploit.\r\nH: Why pre-1988 Korea?\r\nJ: That was the last time it was the same Korea as my parents, where they had the actual values of handling their business, knowing their role, working hard, getting your work done.\r\nH: When did your parents immigrate?\r\nJ: My dad came in 1975. My mom came in 1978. I say 1988 because the Olympics were in Seoul that year. That was the year we became a force in international business. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m very happy with what happened in Korean. Japan was the best in Asia, in the world even, then Korea became digital, working away from their analog world. That\'s when we became capitalistic, made money, started becoming a first world country. Now Korea is part of the top 10 in terms of the GDP. It recently entered the World Bank, which is basically the white man\'s bank. It comes with a visa waiver program where you can go to any country in the world for 40 or so days without a visa of any kind, very few countries have that kind of power, even Mexico doesn\'t have that. I learned from pre-1988 Korea how to work hard.\r\nH: So what would you classify yourself as? What are you?\r\nJ: An American of Korean descent.\r\nH: If you had to fight in a war between America and Korea, on whose side would you fight? and why?\r\nJ: This is really hard. America. Because I\'m an American. I\'ve lived her for 25 years.\r\nH: Do you think America is exceptional?\r\nJ: Definitely. America is exceptional compared to the rest of the world.\r\nH: Why did you want to become the President of KASA (Korean-America Student Association) at UCI?\r\nJ: For a multitude of reasons. For my friends... all of my friends were on staff. I was on staff. If no one stepped up, the club would die. So I stepped up.\r\nH: Why did you join KASA?\r\nJ: It had the most amount of people I could relate to, because of their ethnicity/culture... they\'re part of who you are.\r\nH: Korean-Americans are closer than Americans?\r\nJ: I\'m more comfortable with Korean-Americans, but it depends on the Korean-Americans. I would ask: How did they come here? Why did they come here? What kind of visa do they hold: amnesty, business, investments? How old are they? But don\'t get me wrong, I love being Korean, and by Korean I mean the country not the people. But I\'m an American all the way... it stands for something that no other country does. You can be whoever you want to be regardless of where you\'re from. That\'s America\'s greatest ideal, no matter if they are a reality. I like the ideal core value of America.\r\nH: What is Korea\'s ideal value?\r\nJ: I think Korea\'s ideals are deeply rooted in its culture of a shame-based society. I think it has a lot to do with how Korea grew up... as always the underdogs, dependent and dominated by other countries, namely Japan. There\'s lots of shame and a certain image they want to portray of now being weak. I even think its rooted in Confucianism.\r\nH: How so?\r\nJ: The Confucian ideas that anything that\'s something bad or inappropriate, something that should be dealt with internally, should stay there.\r\nH: The Korean male stereotype?\r\nJ: Yes. That shame-based culture, that need, extended to America through the pre-1988 parents.\r\nH: What about the new Korean-Americans?\r\nJ: Well, to me, the 1.5 generation must have equal influence from both sides - Korea and America. They must be equally fluent in both languages. 3rd generation would be my children, your children.\r\nH: Well, what about the new Koreans in Korea? The Wonder Girls Koreans?\r\nJ: Hm... yes & no with the same. Yes some have that shame-based culture ingrained in them, but some are without those ideals. I think the Koreans in America can be considered more traditional than those in Korea because we have the pre-1988 Korean ideals, the real Korea of which I can and am proud of.\r\nH: Do you remember Saigu (4/29 - the LA Riots)?\r\nJ: I was 5, so I don\'t remember much. I just remember my parents saying that we can\'t go to LA right now. My grandma wanted to get some stuff from LA, we were living in Lake View Terrace, and they said, \"We cannot go to LA right now. Later.\" Koreans got owned for not having representation in government, so after the LA Riots, we woke up... everybody in the Korean community woke up. No one was there to watch our back, even the police. So we started KASA, Chongdae, KAC, and more. Asians are still the most underrepresented minority in America because they mind their own business. They just want to improve their own lives, not the community.\r\nH: What do you think of Saigu?\r\nJ: It was a learning opportunity, a wake-up call. I think it was self-inflicted to a certain degree, but its not any one person\'s particular fault. It definitely united the Korean-American Los Angeles community. It was the catalyst for us to have these organizations, Korean attorneys in the actual DA office where they can make a difference, Korean police officers, politicians... It all started from those Korean organizations.\r\nH: Is there anything you are proud of for Korea?\r\nJ: I think Korea is best at seeing an idea and make it better, making it their own. I mean they get all those ideas from Japan, but that\'s okay because everyone borrows from each other, from different countries. But if you copied it and made it worse.... that\'s bad. But taking that and making it better, that\'s what Korea does really well. Did you know that back in the day Mitsubishi was selling this crap design, saying that it was the worst and it would never amount to anything that it was really bad, less than anything ever made. Then Hyundai bought that car design and now its on its way to be one of the best! Korea can\'t make something borrowed worse because of that shame ideal. It\'s why so many Koreans have a church car but live in an apartment, why they have True Religion jeans, & etc... It\'s the ideal of showing that they\'re fine. It\'s about the pride, showing no weakness.','','',0,0),(98,62,112,92,'Korean Starcraft Folklore','Fieldnotes','INT: When did you move to the United States?\r\nGG: The beginning of this fall quarter, I came to the U.S for the first time to go to UCLA.\r\nINT: What is your major GG?\r\nGG: I am actually a PhD math student.\r\nINT: Where did you go to school in Korea?\r\nGG: Seoul National University.\r\nINT: What is your focus now?\r\nGG: Game and number theory.\r\nINT: When did you being playing Starcraft?\r\nGG: I started playing Starcraft in middle school [1997] and started to get more into it when Brood War [Starcraft expansion pack] came out [1998].\r\nINT: What is Starcraft like in Korea?\r\nGG: Literally every Korean guy can play Brood War, it would be hard to find a young person who can’t. They might not be very good, but they definitely know what Starcraft is and have played before.\r\nINT: Did you play at PC Bangs [internet cafes]?\r\nGG: Yes, I used to go to PC Bangs every day after school. They are where everybody went.\r\nINT: Can you tell me more about them?\r\nGG: Well internet cafes were a really big deal, I didn’t grow up in Seoul but I lived in a town the size of Westwood, and in my town there were probably between 30 and 40 internet cafes. Seoul must have had over 6,000. We would play as teams using battle net [the Starcraft Land Area Network and online network to play with other Koreans]. The cafes were very cheap when I was young. They would cost only about two dollars an hour, but now it might be only 50 cents an hour.\r\nINT: How much time would you spend in these cafes?\r\nGG: At least an hour per day, every day. The most would be 6-7 hours.\r\nINT: Would there be people who played even longer?\r\nGG:  There were special deals where you could play from 10 pm to 8 am for only five dollars. Everyone had to take naps to last through the whole ten hours. The cafes even sold cheap energy drinks to keep kids up longer\r\nINT: Why do you think Starcraft is popular in Korea?\r\nGG: The pro gamers, everyone wants to be like them. In Brood War, the first pro gamer was Ssam Jjang. He was the first Korean to play the game like a job and everyone saw that he was a pro.\r\nINT: Did you admire Ssam?\r\nGG: Yes, me and my friends all admired his strategies and the way he played. But even though a few pro gamers make it big, many don’t. Even if you do become a pro gamer, only 10-20 become famous out of hundreds of pros.\r\nINT: How do you become a pro?\r\nGG: You need to win a tournament to gain a certificate through the Korean E-Sports Association [KESPA], it is really hard. I don’t know anyone who has passed it, there are too many good players who play so much.\r\nINT: How good are you? [I had actually seen GG play at the UCLA Starcraft Club the previous week]\r\nGG: Well my APM [actions per minute] is super high, but I am not really good. I would get up to around 280 APM but still lose to 40 APM gold players [GG is joking and laughing about this].\r\nINT: How technical is Starcraft?\r\nGG: Starcraft I was very technical, you could only group 12 units at a time, and the UI [user interface] was bad. If you commanded 100 Zerg units, it would be very difficult.\r\nINT: Can you tell me more about Starcraft in Korea?\r\nGG: Starcraft is seen everywhere, including television. Brood war was on two major channels, NBC Game and On Game Net.\r\nINT: How did the live channels work?\r\nGG: They streamed online matches and live tournaments when they were held.\r\nINT: Has anything inspired you in Starcraft?\r\nGG: I really liked early tournaments, Seoul had an arena made for Starcraft and I would drive by it sometimes. I also really looked up to early pros like Slayer Boxer, he really created esports [electronic sports] in Korea.\r\nINT: What is it like playing with a team?\r\nGG: Team slayer is all about helping and attacking as a unit, which make teams bond and friendships grow. We might joke around sometimes, but we are usually very focused on the game.\r\nINT: How important is winning?\r\nGG: Every game is important to win, if a game is lost, blame might be cast on someone on the team. I think that every Korean has a very strong desire to win and has a sense of honor. Getting 2nd place might be good in America, but there is a good chance of a Korea feeling very bad about 2nd place. This intensity and desire has only gotten worse since Starcraft has become a real sport.\r\nINT: Do girls play Starcraft?\r\nGG: Girls don’t like to play, but they will follow the game. Many girls go to the stadium to see the players and go to fan-meetings after. At the meetings, some girls will even give presents to their favorite pros.\r\nINT: Do you think Starcraft will continue to have a huge influence in Korea?\r\nGG: Yes, Starcraft started an entirely new culture and has created new jobs which are full of excitement.\r\nINT: Do parents know what Starcraft is?\r\nGG: Yes, every parent knows about it. Everyone in Korea knows about it. Once, I heard a story that there was a middle school student who played so much Starcraft that he got really bad grades. His dad really hated this so he started playing Starcraft himself to get really good. He played his son and beat him, so his son realized it was time to go back to studies [GG is laughing while reciting this story].\r\nINT: Do you think Koreans are inherently better at Starcraft?\r\nGG: I think that pro gamers are better because they practice, practice, practice. The pro gamers live in a house with other pro gamers, they play 16 hours a day with a strict schedule. That’s why Koreans are better, they have coaches who analyze their builds [how a Starcraft player makes units to attack opponents] and strengths.\r\nINT: If you see another Korean guy, will you talk about Starcraft?\r\nGG: Yes, it usually comes up, you ask what race [there are four “races” for players to choose from] do you play? Or which pros do you like?\r\nINT: Can you compare Starcraft in Korea to anything in America? \r\nGG: I’m not too sure, I haven’t been in America long enough. You really have to play and see Starcraft in Korea to really understand it.\r\n','Geunho Gim Notes Pg 1.pdf','application/pdf',692552,1604587),(99,62,116,93,'Korean Starcraft Folklore','Fieldnotes','INT: Can you give me your info AY?\r\nAY: I’m a second year electrical engineering major at UCLA.\r\nINT: Where are you from?\r\nAY: I’m from Southern California.\r\nINT: When did you start to play Starcraft?\r\nAY: I started playing Starcraft I six years ago but I didn’t really start to play and get into it until Starcraft II came out.\r\nINT: Why do you enjoy playing Starcraft?\r\nAY: It’s really fun and it’s a good way to keep my mind busy, there is a huge multitasking aspect to Starcraft, and things like actions per minute [how many moves or “actions” the player is able to make in a minute] make the game very interesting.\r\nINT: Do you usually play by yourself?\r\nAY: No I usually only play with teams, it is way more fun. It also allows bonding around something fun for the whole team.\r\nINT: What do you think about the Korean Starcraft community?\r\nAY: I think the entire Starcraft community is all about improving oneself, there is definitely a desire to be the best one can be across all cultures.\r\nINT: Do you think Koreans are inherently better at Starcraft?\r\nAY: I think training enables Koreans to be better. This seems to reflect a general Asian mentality to try extremely hard at things like Starcraft. Koreans aspire to be as good as these pros who practice so hard.\r\nINT: When did you play the most Starcraft?\r\nAY: I played the most during freshman year [UCLA], I would play for a couple hours a day and sometimes more. Even though I don’t play anymore, I still help admin and mod [administer and moderate] tournaments online. I don’t get paid and it takes up a good deal of time to watch all of the games and design brackets but I love to do it.\r\nINT: Do you think Starcraft is a nerdy game?\r\nAY: Yes, nerds like this game. It might be because Starcraft exercises the brain much more than other games. It has much greater depth than games like Halo or Modern Warfare.\r\nINT: Do you use any Korean jokes when you play Starcraft?\r\nAY: [Laughing] Yes, sometimes I will joke around with the players by telling them Oh, I’m Korean, don’t worry about it, or look out! I’m Korean!\r\nINT: Do you feel more Korean or American?\r\nAY: I think I’m pretty Americanized, I call myself part of generation 2.5. My parents speak fluent English, but I guess when I play Starcraft, I think of myself as more Korean. However, when I play Starcraft with Koreans, I feel like a foreigner. My favorite pros are also foreigners, like Idra who has a great play style.\r\nINT: What do you mean by foreigner?\r\nAY: Anyone who isn’t truly Korean.\r\nINT: Do people know you are Korean when you play online?\r\nAY: Yeah, I think being Korean distinguishes myself in the game, and people can see that my gamertag is tofumaniac so people thing I am either Korean or a vegetarian.\r\nINT: Is Starcraft a Korean game?\r\nAY: Yes, Starcraft is an inherently Korean game. New popular games like Heroes of New Earth and League of Legends are not Korean games. It’s important to know that Starcraft is a sport in Korea, not just a video game. It’s also a source of big national pride, and is something that Koreans are very concerned with. Blizzard even releases the Korean version of Starcraft first, and then it goes to the rest of the world even though Blizzard is an American company. While the average American won’t know what Starcraft is, literally everyone in Korea does.\r\nINT: Why have you stopped playing Starcraft?\r\nAY: I don’t want to keep losing. Losing multiple games a day is not fun. But the game is still fun, and a lot of people take it very seriously.\r\nINT: Do you think being a Starcraft fan might be related to your difficult major?\r\nAY: Maybe, the game relies heavily on muscle memory and keeping track of everything and this might have a little to do with being in electrical engineering.\r\nINT: Last question, do you have any Starcraft stories or anecdotes?\r\nAY: There is a Youtube video with South Korean and North Korean officials meeting and comparing their war conflicts and strategies to Starcraft strategies.\r\n','Andrew Yoon Notes.pdf','application/pdf',1642703,1613552),(100,62,115,94,'Korean Starcraft Folklore','Fieldnotes','INT: Can you give me your basic info?\r\nDHJ: I’m a freshman business economics major.\r\nINT: Where are you from?\r\nDHJ: My story is a little strange. I was born in Seoul, but moved to the Dominican Republic when I was six months old. I lived there for four years, moved to town an hour south of Mexico City for nine years, then to Illinois for four years, and now I’m here at UCLA.\r\nINT: What do you consider home?\r\nDHJ: I think Mexico is my home. It’s where I spent the most time. I don’t feel too Korean and I think my culture is more connected to that of the Americas, North and South.\r\nINT: Is there a Korean community in Mexico City?\r\nDHJ: There are actually 30,000 Koreans in Mexico City and they all attend the same churches, but the Korean community has started to recently become more secular.\r\nINT: Where did you being playing Starcraft?\r\nDHJ: I began playing Brood War [Starcraft I expansion pack] while I was in Mexico, every Korean guy in Mexico played. I think when one Korean person starts doing something, every other Korean will follow.\r\nINT: How often did you play?\r\nDHJ: I would play every day at home, the Mexican internet cafes did not have good internet. Whenever I play, if I lose a few times in an hour, I will stop while I’m ahead. But, if I’m winning games, I can play for two or three hours straight.\r\nINT: When you play with people online, do they know you are Korean?\r\nDHJ: No one can tell I am Korean when I play online, but I sometimes use Korean to cuss at players after games.\r\nINT: Is this common for Korean players?\r\nDHJ: Yeah, I think that most Korean men have anger problems. I think it comes from the way they are raised. Having to serve in the military encourages using force instead of talking about or discussing problems.\r\nINT: Do you ever go back to Korea?\r\nDHJ: I go back every two summers, but when I’m there, I don’t play Starcraft. Everyone expects me to study. The last time I was in Korea, I had to study for the SAT. School really does come first.\r\nINT: Do you know any Starcraft jokes or saying?\r\nDHJ: Many people say the Blizzard [the video game company which makes Starcraft] is the government of Korea.\r\nINT: Do you like to play by yourself or with a team?\r\nDHJ: I only play when my other friends are playing.\r\n[We realize that both DHJ and I had both attended the UCLA Barcraft (a night when Starcraft fans watch live Starcraft tournaments in Korea while drinking alcohol) event on Thursday, Feburary 23rd. He shares that he made fun of MAS (the organizer of the Barcraft) during the semifinal match up when no one was playing MAS’ race – every player can choose one of four “races” to attack each other].\r\nINT: Do you think Koreans are inherently better at Starcraft?\r\nDHJ: I don’t want to sound biased, but kinda. It’s like the question: are Asians better at math? But while Asians might be good at something, they are not super exceptional. There is no Asian Stephen Hawkings, Asians have basic skills but they also have a cap. I also think that Koreans are more prone to doing things more.\r\nINT: What do you mean by that?\r\nDHJ: Once one Korean person starts doing something, it spreads like crazy. A dongdaemun is a market where people go to buy clothes in Korea, and everyone ends up wearing the same clothes. Everyone has similar ideas in Korea, especially in Seoul. I will see people [in Seoul] wearing the exact same outfit as me. I think Korean fashion is just delayed Japanese fashion like the colored eye contacts which Koreans have started wearing.\r\nINT: Last question, how involved have you been in the Korean community at UCLA? If you see a fellow Korean, will you discuss Starcraft?\r\nDHJ: I don’t have any Korean friends here. I don’t think I’m part of the Korean community but I do go to Korean church. If I saw another Korean, I wouldn’t think to talk about Starcraft.\r\n','Dae Hyun Jun Notes.pdf','application/pdf',2022751,1613627),(101,62,117,95,'Korean Starcraft Folklore','Fieldnotes','INT: Can you tell me about your background?\r\nHC: Sure, I moved to Southern California when I was five from Seoul and I am a freshman engineering major at UCLA.\r\nINT: How about your Starcraft background?\r\nHC: I play pretty casually. I started playing custom games [Brood War expansion pack] when I was in first grade.  I stopped playing for years until I picked it back up in the 9th grade. I started playing hard and wanted to get better in the 11th grade when I began playing competitively. My main goal was to break into diamond and masters [the top 2% of all American players] and after reaching that, I have stopped really playing. I actually haven’t played in a week and a half.\r\nINT: Wow, you were really young when you began playing, do you remember why you started?\r\nHC: I actually don’t remember why I started playing.\r\nINT: How do you feel when you play Starcraft? When you win or lose?\r\nHC: I look at it pretty rationally, if I lose it doesn’t matter since you can learn much more from a loss than a win.\r\nINT: Do you see yourself as part of the Korean community here? Will you discuss Starcraft with other Koreans?\r\nHC: I actually don’t really hang out with other Koreans. I personally do not know any other Koreans here who play Starcraft. Starcraft II does come up in come up in conversations with other Koreans, but it is not something to keep talking about.\r\nINT: Are you still a part of the Starcraft community?\r\nHC: Yes, I watch Starcraft more than I play. Even when I’m not playing, I still watch matches [online]. I’m interested in watching the meta-game evolve and I’m really a fan of the game.\r\nINT: Do you enjoy playing at home or events where everyone is physically present?\r\nHC: I prefer to play online from home.\r\nINT: Why do you think Starcraft II is currently so popular in Korea?\r\nHC: Starcraft I and Starcraft II are riding momentum from when everyone bought it after its release, but I’m not sure if this dominance will continue, there are other games now but I think that Koreans will make the switch from Brood War [Starcraft I expansion pack] to Starcraft II.\r\nINT: What are your opinions on the game itself?\r\nHC: When it came out, I thought it might be too easy. The mechanics are much easier than Starcraft I, and people do not used advanced tactics. This is getting better, but the game still has room to get even better.  There might need to be a drastic change in play style for it to be as deep as Brood Wars. Brood War teams have been funded by large companies which have been around longer. All of this helps the competitive scene.\r\nINT: Is Starcraft II the same?\r\nHC: Starcraft II teams have players who live in the same house and play together, but this isn’t as good as having big sponsors. The major sponsors are now in the U.S.\r\nINT: Do you see yourself as an American or a Korean?\r\nHC: I identify as a Korean, but culturally, I think I live more like an American.\r\nINT: Do you feel traditionally Korean parental pressure?\r\nHC: No, I don’t know how a Korean parent is supposed to act. They want me to do well, but not go crazy doing it, they do give me freedom.\r\nINT: Would you root for Korea or America in a soccer cup match?\r\nHC: I would root for Korea.\r\nINT: Where would you like to end up living? Korea?\r\nHC: I might consider living in Korea in the future for a bit, but my dream is to end up in Europe.\r\nINT: Do you believe there is a correlation between being a fan of Starcraft and having science of engineering majors?\r\nHC: There might be a correlation between the two, but it is not a cause and effect.\r\nINT: Do you have any Starcraft anecdotes or stories?\r\nHC: There was a Korean pro named CALM who was playing really, really badly. Everyone said that his evil twin Clam showed up and played for him. There was another player named Fantasy who started playing incredible and everyone called him a terrorist because he was terrorizing his group [tournaments begin with group play].\r\nINT: Any last thoughts on Starcraft in Korea?\r\nHC: Computer games are extremely popular, everyone has played games at some point. PC Bangs are key because many Koreans don’t have advanced computers to properly run new games.\r\n','Hyunkyu Chai Notes.pdf','application/pdf',2364114,1613683),(102,14,122,89,'Korean Exceptionalism','Fieldnotes','H = Interviewer; N = Nina Han\r\n\r\nH - How would you describe your ethnicity?\r\nN - Korean.\r\nH - How would you rate your level of Korean pride? On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best.\r\nN - 3 or 4. Enough to appreciate my heritage. I consider myself a Brazilian citizen more than a Korean. I moved here from Brazil when I was 11. That\'s why my Portuguese is better than my Korean. I wanted to be better in my Portuguese because I cared, but my Korean fell to the wayside because it wasn\'t a huge deal to me.\r\nH - So if there was a sports match with Korea versus Brazil, who would you root for?\r\nN - Definitely Brazil.\r\nH - Korea versus America?\r\nN - Ooh. That\'s a tough one. Korea. I\'d cheer for both, but I\'d hope Korea wins... mainly because they\'re the underdog.\r\nH - I\'m taking this Korean folklore class, but it\'s not just about \r\nKorean myths and fairytales. It\'s about culture and traditions and the reasons why Koreans do things. The lore of the folk, if you will. So I\'m doing this research project on Korean exceptionalism... you know how Korean think they\'re so good at everything...\r\nN - Oh yeah, because Koreans don\'t have much to be proud of because they\'re still a developing country. But they are one the best and top rated developing countries, meaning that they\'re developing the fastest. Even the World Cup in 2002, no one really knew what Korea was until that... Korea put a lot of money into their tourism for the World Cup. They were one of the first countries to make money off of that, even though they co-hosted with Japan. I even lived in Korea.\r\nH - How was it?\r\nK - I couldn\'t get along with Koreans. I hated Korea. I would never go back. I went in 2005 to 2006, for a year and a half. I could not conform to their culture. They\'re very superficial. It was very difficult. It could be because I\'m more tomboyish. But they\'re all about the surface level. It\'s harder to get to their core, to connect with them, as a foreigner. But for myself, I might as well have been a white person. I felt comfortable, but I just could not assimilate.\r\nH - Why did you stay there?\r\nN - I moved there because my visa expired. I was so happy to see Americans. I felt really happy!! Once even, I ran into some Brazilian girls in Korea. I approached them and was like, \"You\'re Brazilian! Me too!!\" But with Americans, I was just happy inside. I didn\'t approach them. I just identify with Brazil more in general. I like Korean food though. Koreans were the first to just mix stuff together, like leftovers all mixed together... like with pudaetchikae, bibimbap, tchikae, and stuff\r\nH - What do you think Koreans have to be proud of?\r\nN - I still appreciate everything Korean. I just consider myself more Brazilian. Like if KM and EM split, I\'d go with KM (** Side note. KM = Korean Ministry within our church, EM = English Ministry within our church. This sparked a huge debate between some of the listeners.)\r\nH - Oh really? Why?\r\nN - Well, because I served in KM and Education Department for so long. I don\'t feel connected to EM, but the deacons and elders for KM I do. I grew up with them. I serve the church. Probably the KM loyalty involves the fact that my grandparents started the Brazilian church with Jim Bob\'s grandparents. (**Side note. Pastor Jim Bob was the first senior EM pastor who started EM alongside KM. The grandparents\' church was in Brazil, another branch of our current church.)\r\nN - Like the deacon and elder elections, I vote. (People present who feel more connected to EM vote.) I\'m fairly involved in both ministries.. With KM, I\'m a Junior High teacher and serve in AWANA). With EM, I\'m in charge of Sports Ministry. It\'s just that I\'d rather follow tradition and an ideal of KM than EM.\r\nH - Who would you fight for if Korea and America fought in a war?\r\nN - Ooh. That\'s really hard. I\'d go to Brazil. Haha. I guess if I had to choose, I\'d fight for Korea. I\'m not a US citizen.\r\nH - But if you fight in the army for America, they\'ll give you a citizenship.\r\nN - Oh. For a citizenship, I\'d fight for America.\r\nH - Do you remember the LA Riots?\r\nN - I was in elementary school, so I don\'t remember it super clearly. But my dad had a business in the garment district in downtown. He hired snipers that night. I remember because it was my sister\'s birthday, we sang happy birthday with the cake and he was like, \"Bye!\" and we were all like, \"What?\" But he had to go to the store that night to protect it. He had to tie a white flag to the antennae of his car, so he wouldn\'t get shot at. I wasn\'t too scared because my dad said we were fine. Nothing happened that night, but my friend\'s mom\'s store got looted. But that was all, they were fine from what I remember.\r\nH - The whole thing... how did it make you feel?\r\nN - I was in elementary, what I was confused about was how beating one guy started this whole thing... stealing from each other, hurting each other. On the news, there was this interview where this looter was asked why they were doing this and he responded, \"Because everyone else is.\" It was just uneducated people going with the flow. People who knew what they were doing didn\'t mean for it to happen. Honestly, it just reinforced the racism and stereotypes. It wasn\'t my personal store, so I didn\'t feel the camaraderie.

So how are you doing?\r\nJ: I’m doing great, thank you Sarah\r\nS: I understand that you spent some time in Korea. How did you even first get the opportunity to go?\r\nJ: Well, my boyfriend’s mom actually invited me to go to Korea with their family. So yeah, it was supposed to be a family trip, but she was like, ‘Oh you’re family so join us.’\r\nS: When did you go again?\r\nJ: Winter of 2010. So just a year ago.\r\nS: How long were you there for?\r\nJ: I was there for two weeks. Maybe a little over two weeks. Like the majority of my winter break. \r\nS: How long have you been dating your boyfriend?\r\nJ: Around four years.\r\nS: So I’m sure you already had an idea about Korean culture at least before you went?\r\nJ: Yeah, I went to high school predominantly with Koreans so I already had a lot of exposure to their culture.\r\nS: Did you have certain expectations as you were going there? Like what were you kind of thinking it would be like?\r\nJ: Well, I actually visit Hong Kong and Taiwan almost every year so my expectations of Korea were based on the experiences in those countries. They were very similar.\r\nS: Oh, like in reality, they were?\r\nJ: Yeah, they were pretty similar.\r\nS: In what ways, did you think so?\r\nJ: Well, I’m talking more of like the physical aspect of Korea. Like how the buildings are laid out, how the city’s laid out, the transportation. Like, since the population is congested on the streets. And it’s always busy, like all the stores and restaurants are aligned and everything. A lot of city lights and everything so in that aspect it was very similar.\r\nS: Did you travel mainly with the family or with your boyfriend or did you ever go out by yourself?\r\nJ: I never went out by myself. I don’t think I could have because I didn’t speak the language. But yeah, we went their family. It was six people including me and while we were there we met up with his cousins whom I had already met while they were visiting America. So they were our tour guides and took us everywhere.\r\nS: Where did you stay?\r\nJ: We stayed in… In Seoul, we stayed in a hotel and in Pusan, we stayed in a hotel and then we went to some neighboring cities that were like… One of them was a ski resort and the other one was, I don’t remember the name, but they do a lot of filming there. Like traditional Korean dramas, like um, those were resort/rental homes. \r\nS: Was there a particular experience or story that you have, funny story?\r\nJ: Yup\r\nS: Please share, I mean that’s what I’m collecting so…\r\nJ: I ate pŏndeki? And it was disgusting!\r\nS: Did you know what it was before?\r\nJ: Yeah, no one wanted to eat it, but his dad was like, ‘Oh you have to eat it because you’re in Korea so he made me eat one.’\r\nS: Like on the streets or where were you?\r\nJ: I was on the streets and then he finished the rest for me.\r\nS: Were there other foods you were kind of surprised with? Or that you had never tried before?\r\nJ: Not really surprised, but his mom knew I wanted to try live octopus so she ordered that dish for me. And it was awesome! I loved it.\r\nS: Why was it awesome?\r\nJ: Because it’s still moving on the plate so when you eat it it’s still moving in your mouth. And it gets stuck onto your teeth and your mouth, and then… But you dip it in sesame oil so it’s slimier so you can let it slide down your throat. It’s pretty awesome.\r\nS: What was… Pusan, was that very different from Seoul? \r\nJ: Well, I guess so. We were literally right on the beach where we stayed. But since in both Seoul and Pusan we went to the very… we went to the tourist attractions, it wasn’t that much different for me.\r\nS: Did you have a hard time communicating, or did people assume that you were Korean since you’re Asian?\r\nJ: Yeah, because I was traveling with them and they look Korean I think they assumed I was Korean naturally. Except one time I went to Etude House. I don’t know if you know that.\r\nS: A what?\r\nJ: Etude House? I think that’s what it’s called.\r\nS: Etude House?\r\nJ: Yeah, it’s like a cosmetic brand.\r\nS: Oh yeah.\r\nJ: Yeah, right when I walked in the store rep started talking to me in Chinese immediately. \r\nS: Wow.\r\nJ: And I was like ‘What?’ because I don’t know how she assumed correctly that I was Chinese. I think it’s ‘cause it was in um, Myŏngdong? Is that what it’s called… so she probably gets a lot of visitors and can pretty much differentiate between people.\r\nS: Oh, and did you respond to her?\r\nJ: Yeah, I did. I was like, “Uh—“ (laughs) and then I started talking.\r\nS: In Chinese?\r\nJ: Yeah.\r\nS: But for the most part, no one really approached you since you were in a group.\r\nJ: Yeah. Well actually, um, they were kind of able to tell that they weren’t… because actually the way that they dressed, they could tell that we were from America, so um. In tourist areas like Myŏngdong, they would talk to us in English maybe sometimes.\r\nS: Oh, interesting. Did you feel like they dress really differently than people in America?\r\nJ: Um, I mean we went in December, when it was like freezing, so yeah. Yeah, when I went shopping for clothes, it was very different. \r\nS: Why? Or how… was it different?\r\nJ: I think girls there are a lot more fashionable on average than they are here. And the clothes on- I don’t know how to describe it- but, it was very chic and cute and they love like lace and embroidery and everything.\r\nS: Did you have to like bargain with people?\r\nJ: Well, I didn’t. But his mom or he would do it for me because I couldn’t really speak in Korea.\r\nS: what was your favorite part about your time in Korea?\r\nJ: Um, probably the food experiences. Yeah, we ate everything.\r\nS: Yeah? What’s your favorite food.\r\nJ: I don’t have a particular, but we had like ttŏkpokki and like odeng in the soup stuff. What’s that pancake thing with the cinnamon sugar?\r\nS: Hottŏk?\r\nJ: Yeah, we had that. And that was interesting because every city we went to, or every stand we went to, it tasted different.\r\nS: Interesting. So, you liked the night life?\r\nJ: Yeah.\r\nS: Um, do you think your view of Korea has changed at all? Like after coming back?\r\nJ: I guess so. It hasn’t changed that much because my expectations of Korea, they basically were met. But while I was there, we visited his parents’ family. Some of them still live in the underdeveloped areas, and while we were in the film locations, some of the houses from I don’t even know when, but before the 1950s still existed and we were able to get a tour of what a typical family would look like, and how they would cook. So yeah, in that aspect, I think I gained a lot more respect for Koreans, being able to just make it out on their own.\r\nS: So you said that you met a lot of your boyfriend’s family. How did they receive you and welcome you?\r\nJ: Oh, they were really nice. They were amazed that I ate everything. I think that’s what everyone said. Yeah, they were very hospitable and very welcoming.\r\nS: But then they were trying to talk to you in English?\r\nJ: Yeah, some of them actually spoke a little English so we were able to communicate. \r\nS: Do you think like, it’s helped your relationship with your boyfriend after going to Korea together?\r\nJ: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I already knew their family pretty well, but having to spend like two weeks with them twenty four seven helped me bond with them.\r\nS: Do his parents speak English well?\r\nJ: Not very well. But we still manage to communicate somehow. \r\nS: Were you able to see any, learn about any tradition that stuck out to you particularly? Or like a fact about Korean culture? \r\nJ: No, I don’t think so. Does a Korean spa count?\r\nS: Korean Spa? Oh yeah, so you visited a Korean spa? How was that?\r\nJ: Okay, so it was right after we went skiing at the resort and like, I guess they’re known for their spa. His mom just pulled me in casually and said, ‘Oh yeah, let’s go’ so I grabbed my bathing suit and everything… and then when she saw me wear that, she and the aunt started laughing. And I was like, ‘What?’ and she said ‘You’re not supposed to wear that in’ and I didn’t know that, so that was very interesting.\r\nS: So you went in, without the bathing suit?\r\nJ: Well, I had a towel the whole time.\r\nS: Okay.\r\nJ: But everyone else didn’t (Laughs).\r\nS: So did they pay any particular attention to you because you were walking around with a towel?\r\nJ: I mean, no, there weren’t that many people. \r\nS: And it was your first time going to a bath house like that?\r\nJ: No, I went to one in Japan with my mom before and one in Taiwan, but I was like really young, so it didn’t really… And when we went to the one in Japan, my mom strategically at like 4:00 AM in the morning when no one else was there.\r\nS: That’s so funny. I mean, were there any other times when you were doing something, or thought one way, but you actually found out it was not supposed to be done that way or something like that?\r\nJ: Um, I don’t think so, yeah. \r\nS: Would you ever want to go back again?\r\nJ: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.\r\nS: Would you ever live there?\r\nJ: Live there? Because of the weather, I’d say no. Yeah, it was freezing. I’d never been in such cold weather before. \r\nS: And it was snowing while you were there too?\r\nJ: Yeah, it was snowing and we rented a car so it was actually pretty scary driving because were sliding sometimes.\r\nS: Do people even usually walk around outside when it’s that cold?\r\nJ: Yeah they do. I’ve seen girls in heels there before too and people. And when we were in Myŏngdong, I stood in one spot waiting for everyone because they were shopping and I saw so many people just slip. It was like…\r\nS: And fall?\r\nJ: Yeah, slip and fall. It was so bad. ‘Cause like, the road literally froze.\r\nS: Oh my gosh, so you’re like ice skating kind of.\r\nJ: Yeah (laughs)\r\n','jackie chan interview.mp3','audio/mp3',15333168,1622272),(105,17,-1,90,'Overseas Mission Experiences ','Fieldnotes','1.	Name, age, year, church/program, where you went on missions\r\nJae Lim, 22 yrs old, Holliston Korean United Methodist Church, China, Summer 2007 \r\n2.	Explain what motivated your decision to go overseas\r\nI just thought it was gonna be fun and I think I went to a leadership conference that motivated me to do missionary work since I didn’t really do that and I thought being a missionary wasn’t meant for me but after that conference I realized that everyone is called to missions even though it’s not long term and so I thought I would go and the opportunity came up. \r\n3.	Explain what the training process entails\r\nSince I was a children’s teacher, my group of the ministry was doing VBS for the kids, it was learning the VBS material and had experience in VBS from the past, had to relearn every material front and back and spent a lot of time going through the material and learn how to deal with kids and how to deal with kids that are not born in a Christian family \r\nWe first had a therapist come in or a counselor and we went over the personality test with everyone and we took the Myer’s Briggs test and discussed how to handle kids with different type of personality and hands on training\r\nOther things we did was fast, for like a month had morning prayers and do training and we also had to learn historically about China and about their customs and their rules and regulation on Christianity there and what we can do and can’t do and how we’re supposed to respect their culture. \r\n-If you’re not prepared, it obviously shows and with the whole learning the VBS program, that whole purpose is kinda like you have to show that you care by their action and show that you put in that much time in, kids are more responsive and they seem to lack interest if they know you’re just winging it. \r\n-Fasting and praying would be to trusting God more and not just teaching them something but reaching out and showing them God’s love and with that truly relying on him and they woke up every day and surrendered ourselves and asking him for strength because without God there’s no real purpose and just learning material and just went. We had a purpose and to have that purpose we needed to have God in our lives. \r\na.	Make sure to note what the purpose of each activity was for the mission trip\r\n4.	Who/How was your team, its dynamics, and your interactions with other members\r\nMy team was specifically children’s teachers that volunteered to go and dynamics were hard for me because they were kinda older and I was the youngest children’s teacher at my church and I was close to them still but I was on different place with them so it wasn’t as tight\r\n-but learned a lot being the youngest and see what is going on and really be able to ask questions \r\n-but I guess when I first went into, I expected fun too but then there weren’t people really my age so that helped me focus more on what I was doing and not just having fun and not just a vacation trip with my friends. \r\na.	What is the role of the team leader \r\nThe children’s pastor and his role was to oversea what we were doing and whenever we had struggles with a kid and with each other we would confide in him and he would be able to regulate. He made the decisions and as well as like guiding us in the right path, even spiritually and gave us questions to think about and made preparations and curriculum. It was everything he chose so he knew everything we did. \r\nb.	What was your role in the team\r\n5.	What were your feelings leading up to this point of the training process? \r\nThe morning prayers were tiring and sometimes I really didn’t want to wake up and felt really drained but at the same time, we taught the same material to the kids at our church and seeing children learn these things it made everything worth it and even though some parts of the training wasn’t fun I could tell it would make a difference so it was still rewarding \r\n\r\n6.	How did you prepare the funds for the trip?\r\nSince I was young, in high school, a lot of funding was done for me so I didn’t have to do that much funding but I did send out letters to people like other teachers or like families at church or even like parents at church. So the funding was asking them if you could support me in prayer or financially. But since I was in high school, there wasn’t a certain amount of money that I had to make. So most of it was done through the church. \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n7.	How was the lifestyle different in this country than in America?\r\nEverything is different. The culture is different, the language. Me being Asian wasn’t as bad coming in as foreign but being in a capitalist country like America it was interesting to see how other parts of the world are. We think about poverty and stuff- it’s mind blowing to see what you wouldn’t expect to see. It was hard to be acclimated because it seemed surreal—but it seemed like you were just watching a movie so it was kind of mind blowing.\r\nLike every day goes by and you become more acclimated in where you are as hard as it was. \r\n\r\n8.	What did you do while you were on missions? (specifics)\r\na.	Describe various instances/events \r\nThere was an orphanage there and my team went there to a couple orphanages and just went in and instead of just starting right away, we played with the kids and hung around the playground and brought toys and had fun with them .We had snacks provided for them and we had the program we had to do. We started on the VBS program which was broken into groups, we broke them into groups and we had different stations and I had man the games station and in my station I came up with games to play with them. Stuff like relay races \r\nWe didn’t overnight in any of them and when I wasn’t doing my VBS stuff I would help out with other ministries as well in setting up. Sometimes I just went out and looked around to see what was going on and had free time and be of help whenever they need me.\r\nOther teams were like worship team that was focused on adults and there were a couple that painted houses and some teams that taught TKD to kids and painted houses and there were teams that made food and teams that went out to underground churches in China and get to come out \r\nEveryone total would be like 50-60 people. \r\n\r\n9.	What kinds of people did you interact with/meet?\r\na.	How did you interact with the indigenous people\r\nFor me a lot of my interactions were kids and they’re so much easier to talk to and interact with .It was sometimes intimidating talking to the adults with the language barrier but they were all so open and willing and it was really a blessing and I know there were interactions with the adult ministries but for me since it was with children, they were all accepting and pretty fun and happy people. It was surprising to see how happy they could be with so little and made me feel so greedy and selfish. And I wonder if I would happy with what they had. \r\n10.	Explain the daily ritual of a day overseas.\r\n11.	What was the most memorable thing about missions\r\nI think just watching kids be happy and that’s what lasted me..to be able to stay in a foreign place and not being able to eat what you want but seeing them enjoying their time and it was good to see them enjoying their time. But I came out thinking that this is what we’re meant to do. \r\n\r\n12.	Did you have small group, accountability, EV partners, etc? Describe those.\r\na.	How was team interaction at this point?\r\nMostly, it was our ministry team since it was a big group and within our team of around like 10 we always paired up and we never did anything alone and in the beginning of the day we would do everything together and talk about how we’ve been doing and tell each other what we’re struggling with and pray for each other. I think if there were no small accountability or partner groups, especially for me being so young, it would’ve been hard for me to approach them and talk to them like how you’re doing and this is what I’m struggling with but since there was someone specifically to be accountable for me it was easier for me to be open and since they were so much older it was like intimidating too. \r\n\r\n13.	What were some specific challenges that you had face? Both personal and eternal. \r\nPhysically it was hard because of the time difference and missing my friends and thinking about what my friends would be doing over the summer because I love having fun and I still wanted interaction with my people. And because I am a picky eater too but its respectful to finish everything they put on your plate and  I don’t eat a lot of vegetables so it was really challenging for me to eat everything I was given. And just waking up so early every morning and having so much to do all day. I think that was the biggest challenges. \r\na.	The hardest part of missions?\r\nb.	The easiest part of missions?\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n14.	How did you feel after the trip was over? \r\nI felt many feelings, one was I was really glad to be back home and I felt really comfortable at home and I was glad I could get my rest, and I did miss the kids so I felt even regretful that I could’ve done more and felt really rewarding doing what I did and gave me a new perspective on missions. \r\n\r\n15.	Did the missions experience just end once you came back to America? If not, what kind of things did you have to engage in Why?\r\nWe had like debriefing sessions and we also had like service at a church service and shared what we did and stuff like that. We had like dinner together and stuff like that. This shows that like me personally this is how I went to missions, this is how I was exposed to missions through leadership conference and through showing others, they might want to think about and that’s what starts it all just thinking about it. \r\n16.	How did mission supporters play a role in your overall experience?\r\n17.	If you could take one thing from your experience, what would it be? \r\n18.	Would you go overseas again for missions? Why or why not.\r\nIf I had the opportunity I would but I know that it is costly and I’m not a high school student anymore and I won’t get that much financial help but if I could then of course.

We were at a restaurant and he took out a ring, and asked me to marry him.\r\n\r\nG: What did you wear on your wedding day?\r\nWS: I wore a wedding dress.\r\n\r\nG: Really? Why didn\'t you wear a hanbok?\r\nWS: I also wore a hanbok, but I wore it for paebaek.\r\n\r\nG: Can you tell me stuff about your wedding?\r\nWS: I got married when I was about your age…early 20s. I didn\'t go to college because your father wanted to marry me as soon as possible. (laughs) We got married in Seoul and we went to Jeju for our honeymoon. We didn\'t get married in a church but in a wedding shop.\r\n\r\nG: What is a wedding shop?\r\nWS: In Korea, they have wedding shops where you can have your wedding ceremony. They provide everything.\r\n\r\nWS: Hmm…the wedding commentator was my high school teacher.\r\n\r\nG: Do you know what you were doing throughout the entire wedding ceremony and preparation?\r\nWS: I didn\'t really care about doing paebaek cause everyone else did it in Korea. I did everything your grandma told me to do. Your grandma picked out my hanbok and told me how to do my make up and hair. She basically took care of everything and I was the one who did as I was told. Before the ceremony, I got a gift box. The gift box is part of Korean tradition too.\r\n\r\nG: What was inside of your gift box?\r\nWS: There was perfume, jewelry, and a paper with something written on it. (We both were unable to translate this properly). The paper was meant for me and your dad to have good luck in the future.\r\n\r\nG: Do you want me to have a traditional Korean wedding?\r\nWS: Yeah, I want you to do a lot of the same stuff I did when I got married. Paebaek is something that is part of Korean tradition, so you have to do it. It\'s also a one time thing you do in your life, so it\'s good to have that memory. It\'s something you want to look back on and say you did that. Even if you didn\'t marry a Korean guy, I want you to do paebaek.

The conversation began at about 12:30 PM.\r\nH = interviewer. O = Hye Kim. D = Hee Kim.\r\n\r\nO - Oh yeah. Our ancestors were very smart. So scientific!\r\nH - It\'s not scientific. It\'s mythical, magical, superstitious.\r\nO - No... they didn\'t know about the iron back then, but they had very good sense. They learned after eating the miyokguk so.... Even mutchangach\'i, it gets dried in sunlight, right? In Korea, they dry roots and trees and reboil them for food. When you dry it, apparently the nutrients get brought up and increased. Isn\'t that weird? A lot of foods are dried in Korea even before they found this out.\r\nH - But they didn\'t know that there\'s a lot of nutrients. It was just because they needed to preserve it.\r\nD - Oh yeah. Of course. In the winter, they can\'t grow mu and other vegetables, so they dried them to preserve it.\r\nO - There wasn\'t a lot of meat, so they used a lot of dried vegetables and roots in soups and stuff. But I don\'t think they had NO idea. Because of hanyak, you know...\r\nD - They didn\'t know that certain herbs were really good, but they experimented with other peoples and recorded and continued and found hanyak to be good for certain symptoms. There\'s a lot of foods for different illnesses. Lie for a cough there\'s doraji, mu, saengkangch\'a (ginger tea which is sour is added with daech\'u (dates) for sweetness). For a cut on a finger, they\'d pour ojingo bones... like that white powder that Mom has!! Or for blurry eyes or tiredness, they\'d give you kyormyongcha (seed tea). To make your eyes better, they\'d give you liver. When I was young, my grandma seasoned it raw or it was fried for the people who don\'t like it. Liver has a lot of Vitamin 12, but they learned through experiments and experience. Because there weren\'t any vitamin tablets in Korea at that time, even still actually. That\'s why we always bring fish oil tablets or vitamins whenever we go to Korea. They\'re hard to find in Korea and are very expensive. They\'re mostly imported from USA anyways.\r\nO - But isn\'t it better without vitamins, to get it naturally?\r\nD - Oh yeah. Of course.\r\nO - I remember, they would always give me wonkiso in the morning. It was so delicious. I loved it. I used to sleep really fast at night, so I could drink another one the next morning.\r\nH - What is wonkiso?\r\nO - It\'s a revitalizing product. It\'s kosohan.\r\nD - In North Korea, they said that when they got sick, they\'d just eat a vitamin and they\'d get better almost instantly. So they\'re lacking food, Korean food, that would give them the nutrients naturally. And when they get a vitamin tablet, everything gets better because it acts as makeshift food. Korea is so good right now. So many foreigners want to eat Korean food because it\'s so good for you. Especially the Chinese. And it\'s much better than white people\'s food. You know we have pine trees in our country, right?\r\nH - In Korea?\r\nD - Yes. How many pine trees are in our country? We have 4 kinds, mostly. But in different areas they grow differently. Geographically different species, but they have different characteristics. There\'s one type in Hamgyongdo in the Northeast region of the Korean peninsula. The second type is Gumdangsan, famous mountains in the world. Many scholars gathered together to determine the best mountains in the world, and they voted for Gumdang as number 1. The third kind is in Kyongju, the Silla capital. There they have the Ankanghyong pine. The fourth one is in Jarrado. It\'s in the Chunggu style. The pine in Hamgyongdo has a long, straight trunk with small short branches. You know why? Because the branches would fall off with all the snow that would pile onto them. The second pine in Gumdangsan has branches that go off like an umbrella, like a stereotypical pine because they don\'t have much snow there. The third one in Kyongju, it\'s trunk grows twisted. Do you know why? Silla is famous for its 1000 year history. They had to make a lot of temples and bridges, right? They cut down all of the straight trees for lumber, so they left all the curvy, twisty ones. These were the best and only trees for lumber, so if you just use things without concern for the future... you will ruin things. The fourth one in Chunngu is similar to the second one, but it\'s a little bit different because of the climate. So because of this, we learn a lesson.\r\nO - Oh, that\'s very interesting.\r\nD - So in our country, Korea, we have a joke. We had a lot of big-scale wars with Japan and etc, like Ipchinweran when the Japanese came to conquer and a lot of people died. Their agenda was to conquer China so they wanted to use our roads, but we wanted to be favorable with China so we said no. So, like in the Bible in Canaan, Joshua asks Canaan to borrow their roads and they said no, so they attacked. So this is the exact same thing. That\'s like war verbage, that\'s like asking to go to war. So the joke is... Woman is better than man because at that time, all the strong men died because of the wars, so left over are the weak persons, the weak boys. So like the trees in Ankanghyong, where all the weird trees are left... so now in Korea, all the women are still strong and the boys are weak.  North Korea invaded South Korea too... when a lot of young men had to go to the army. A lot of people died, a lot of Koreans died, and a million people died in Ipchinweran and about a million died in the North Korean invasion, so there really weren\'t a lot of men left. Kind of like unnatural selection. So even in Korean history, women athletes have fared better. The first medal in Olympics for Korea was a woman... in basketball! I think it was a silver medal. The next one, I think was a medal for the marathon but that was a man, so forget that. Boxing and wrestling has a lot of medals, but that\'s men. But team sports, women from Korea received those first.\r\n\r\nAnd then we arrived at our destination at 1:06 PM.','','',0,0),(108,17,-1,72,'Overseas Mission Experiences ','Audio','GK: Esther Oh, you are a 2nd year, and what church or program did you go with?\r\nEO: All Nations Church\r\nGK: Where did you go on missions?\r\nEO: Bangalore, India.\r\nGK: Um, and you went in the summer of 2010?\r\nEO: Mhm.\r\nGK: And how long were you there for?\r\nEO: 2 weeks.\r\nGK: And what motivated your decision to go overseas?\r\nEO: Uh, well first of all, it was just to...we were gonna do like a discipleship program so that was really exciting because it gives you a chance to like one-on-one with like a student there  and stuff so they can be a leader and stuff at their school so that was pretty cool. And like we were gonna do student evangelism but we didn’t really get a chance to do that but like  that was like really scary and exciting so like yea just spreading God’s word and stuff like.\r\nGK: Explain what the training process was like.\r\nEO:  Um, the training process…well since we were gonna be a discipler, we like went through the whole one-on-one discipleship program ourselves but it was like a very intensive like very shortened like we learned everything in a very short time so like that part was kinda bad, but and like we would do like praise, we would learn like body worship like in a room without AC because it would be like really hot there and um…we did a lot of like testimony sharing. We always had a guest speaker every like mission training and like they taught us important things that we should always remember at the mission field and um, we were gonna do this like duck-egg thing but like cuz you have to you know when you go overseas you have to eat whatever they give you but we didn’t do that-\r\nGK: Oh, I did that. The balut, I ate it haha\r\nEO: We didn’t do that but it was like basically whenever we were given like anything to eat like we just had to like eat it all. Yea and like praying, raising money, sending out the letters and stuff.\r\nGK: So then, can you go into like more detail about the letters and like how you raised the funds for the trip.\r\nEO: Uh, so I had to write the letter and then I wrote it in Korean too but I got like help from like my friend so the Korean one sounded really good. Um, and then I just sent it out. I gave it to a lot of my friends, mostly family members and like that’s how a lot of the money came in. So we also like fundraised at church. We had like a raffle thing where we uh, like if you got the raffle you would get like a free family photo shoot and like people bought that a lot. And then we did like a taco fundraiser at our church and a lot of people bought that so we got a lot of money from that. Um..yeah a lot of my funds came from my family. My “eemo” or my aunt was really generous and gave me her like, what is it called? Like donation? Yea, well she like gave me a lot and that helped a lot.\r\nGK: Um, let’s see. How was your team like?\r\nEO: Um, I don’t remember how many it was…I think it was 12 or 13 but uh we had 6 girls and like I don’t remember how many guys…shoot. But um yea it was okay with the girls like I was closer to the older girls like not girls that were closer to my age so that was a little weird but um like other than we didn’t have problems like within the team like we were all very supportive and encouraging like that but  we all kind of had problems with our leader uh like he’s a pastor at our church so we kinda knew his style and he was kind of like… he tells you what he thinks and he doesn’t hide it or anything and he was kind of rash in his decisions and having a leader like that was kind of discouraging because you wouldn’t want a leader to be like that. But then like…but it wasn’t like a huge problem. Just like everyone was like a little hurt…a little or like yeah. \r\n\r\nGK: Um, well what was the role of the team leader?\r\n\r\nEO: The team leader just like telling us what we have to do all the time. Um, like encouraging us like uh just like encouraging us and telling us what to do that was it. \r\n\r\nGK: What was your role on the team?\r\n\r\nEO: Well, I had a specific role…I was the team journalist and I had to like write down everything we were going through and stuff so I was always carrying around a journal and like writing in it and stuff like that. Um, but like also it was like I was a disciple for the kid…um, I was on the praise team, part of the skits—everyone was a part of the skits. I had to share my testimony one time during one of the revival days. \r\n\r\nGK: Um, lets see…so like the things that you went through for training and stuff like body worship or like stuff like that what do you think is the purpose of like doing that.\r\n\r\nEO: Well for the discipleship training that was necessary because if we went there unprepared without going through the material once ourselves I don’t think that would’ve been like…that wouldn’t have done God’s word justice or like I don’t know that wouldn’t have been appropriate to teach without being prepared. Um for as the body worship, the kids really liked it when we asked the kids what’s your favorite thing about what we’re doing they all said like the body worship and the songs and the kids really liked it but I don’t know if body worship, it might like I don’t know how to explain it. Like “gamdong sheekyuh”…how would you say that…like draw emotion but I guess for some it could be like that like body worship could draw emotion and the emotion could have significance like that, I don’t know.\r\nGK: So then, how was the lifestyle different in India than from America?\r\nEO: It was a lot different because the food was a lot different because we had to eat with our hands…we eat with our right hands and wipe with our left, but I never did that. I know most of my other team members tried it and we had to get up at 5 every morning because we had to go like morning prayer and exercise. We would sleep pretty early too because we had to get up pretty early.\r\nGK: How were you able to deal with the differences and transitioning and stuff?\r\nEO: Um, I had to do it- it wasn’t like I couldn’t do it. Like I was there for missions not like it was vacation or anything I think our team was in the right mindset all the time. I think there was one time that our missionary person over there- the head of the school- set us out on like a mission kind of thing to another city called Chenai and he sent us out on our own with no help or anything and just gave us bus tickets and was like go! And Bangalore has like nice weather but Chenai had like horribly hot and it was like really hot and my stomach hurt that day too so it was like a horrible day but then like our whole team was like that so we would stop and pray. Just like even though we were suffering we would have to remind ourselves that we’re not here to have a good time or anything it’s like we have to see what this country is like and we have to pray for this country. \r\nGK: So then, what did you do while you were on missions specifically?\r\nEO: Um, well we did the discipleship training everyday thing the whole time we were there. I think we wwould meet with the kids once a day and we would go through a lesson and read it and read a passage with them and ask them questions and stuff like that.\r\nGK: Could they understand?\r\nEO: Like the problem with the kids, like the school was a Christian school and these kids learned like the Bible passages and memorize the Bible and stuff like that but the problem was they didn’t really like feel it like when we would go through the lessons we would ask them like do you know what the Holy Spirit is have you experienced the Holy Spirit they would be like oh what’s the Holy Spirit, we don’t know. They only knew it through their minds but not their hearts and stuff like that and that was very heartbreaking because they know so much but they don’t like um accept it like and like live it out. Um so we did the discipleship thing and we had like a 3 day revival kind of thing where it was praise, sharing of testimony and then a missionary from our church came with us too and he would share like a message and then um, the like kids on the last day they asked the kids to come up if they want to accept Jesus into their lives, like not a lot but a significant number of kids came up and accepted Christ so that was really good. We also did like campus beautification where we uh planted a bunch of flowers at the school and we painted a mural...uh what else…that was like the gist of it.\r\nGK: Um, so what kinds of like…mm. explain what’s like a daily ritual, like a typical day from morning to night.\r\nEO: So we would wake up, get ready really fast, and then walk like 30 min to the seminary school and at the seminary school we would do morning exercise and then we would do like morning worship kind of thing we would like do worship and we would do like a message and usually we would leave early at that time cuz we had to breakfast really fast so we would eat breakfast really fast and we would either walk back or drive back to the school where we were staying at and at school, we would meet with our discipleship students and we would go through that day’s lesson and then…I think we would go down and prepare for like the revival or whatever specific activity we had to do that day and sometimes we would have to, I think the first week after discipleship training we would go to classrooms and do testimony sharing but after that was revival time so I don’t know that part is a little hazy. And then, like obviously we would eat and stuff and we would like um and then like after that I think it was campus beautification usually…and then we would rest up. Um, sometimes we would go visit this one Korean church there and we would uh…what else, I’m not really sure after that. Or like other times we would like, we went to this Indian church this one time, another time we went to Chenai and we went around the city, um…yea and like other time we would follow this one pastor and he would show us around places and talk to us. \r\nGK: How did you interact with all the people—like you had your students but what about the other native people, how was it interacting with them?\r\nEO: They were really nice…um we wouldn’t really talk to the teachers a lot but when we would go into the classrooms to share our testimonies, the teachers would be like very welcoming and if the kids would be misbehaving they would be like shh, listen to the people. The people were like very interested in us because obviously we’re very different and so when we went to the Indian church, it was very interesting because guys and girls are like separated and we would be sitting on the girls side. Um, they would always like look at us but they were always inviting and kind to us but we couldn’t really talk to them because we couldn’t really speak like their language and stuff so we would just be like smiling. \r\nGK: So, did you guys have like small groups or like accountability partners, like EV partners or like…\r\nEO: Within our team?\r\nGK: Yeah\r\nEO: Kinda, like girl-guy kind of thing.\r\nGK: How was the team interaction at this point like everyone got along?\r\nEO: Uh-huh.\r\nGK: What were some specific challenges that you had to face, could be like personal or like physical or like external, whatever challenges.\r\nEO: Um, stomach problems. One time like my ankle swelled up so it was hard to walk around. Like the problem with our leader like how it was sometimes hard to get along with him...what are some other things…\r\nGK: What was the memorable thing about missions?\r\nEO: I think just seeing how the people live and stuff. Um, like we went to the slums one time and that was like that was so sad cause like they like set up slums on these properties and the gov’t can come at any time and wipe them out and that was really sad to hear. And like a lot of my discipleship students their prayer requests would a lot of times they would be like oh for family members and stuff like that cause they were always sick so that was really heartbreaking. I don’t know, they have like cows everywhere and they’re like not allowed to move them. And we heard this story about how there was a cow on a train track or something and the train was going and like the conductor could choose whether to run over the cow or sacrifice the whole train and I think the conductor sacrificed all the passengers. Like these people have like so much like passion for that one religion and it was like really heartbreaking to see them like so devoted to the wrong thing you know and like um, we visited like a temple once, it was really scary you could feel like, like it was really dark in there and these people would give money to the priests and the priests would put like a cone-like thing on their head and that was like a blessing and so it was really interesting to see what they believed in and what they relied on. So it was just really heartbreaking. Like in Chenai, we saw a lot of beggar children and we would put money on the streets and that was heartbreaking too…like just seeing the lifestyle of the people there, it was very dark. \r\nGK: Um, so then when you came back how’d you feel?\r\nEO: Uh, I couldn’t believe that I had just gone to India. Like honestly I was so immature when I went on missions but I learned a lot that it was like God is in every country I think that was on the one big thing like God is everywhere, it’s not like just where we are anything like that, but he cares so much for every single country and we have a duty to pray for those countries and stuff like that. That we’re so lucky here yea, like we have so much freedom to worship God here\r\nGK: Did the missions experience just end for you once you came back to America? If not, what other things did you have to do. \r\nEO: We had to do like debriefing, where we like just reflect on what happened on during missions and stuff like that. Like the official mission team that’s when it ended but like I think missions taught me that like it’s really important to pray for people abroad and we have like a mission even here and stuff like that.\r\nGK: Um, would you go overseas again for mission, why or why not.\r\nEO: I think yes, but not yet because like I’m still very immature in my walk and stuff so I would like to go…the whole time I was going through the discipleship training, I felt very like not worthy of teaching the material because I didn’t even know it that well so I would want to go when I have like a good understanding of the material and like, yeah. \r\nGK: I think that’s good.

My favorite dish of all time would be a Philly cheesesteak.\r\nINT: Do you think Koreans are inherently better at Starcraft?\r\nBK: I didn’t know Starcraft was a Korean thing, I thought it was an Asian thing.\r\nINT: Do you go to Korean New Year events or other traditional functions?\r\nBK: Yes, I always go to New Years with my parents and grandparents but I have no idea what is going on.\r\nINT: Are your parents proud that you go to UCLA?\r\nBK: They might be, but they are not proud of my grades, they always tell me that they suck, but I guess they were proud when I was doing really well in high school.\r\nINT: Last question, do you have any Korean anecdotes or stories?\r\nBK: My white friends joke around and call me a bad Asian because I am a good driver and have no Asian friends.

Name, age, year, church/program, where you went on missions\r\nRebecca Kim, 20, 3rd year, KCM STSM, Uganda for 1 month in 2010\r\n2.	Explain what motivated your decision to go overseas\r\nI honestly had no idea why I wanted to go that year. It was really a spontaneous decision and I applied on the last day but I really felt like God was calling me to go that summer and because I had never gone before, I felt that this would be the perfect opportunity and time for me to go. \r\n3.	Explain what the training process entails\r\na.	Make sure to note what the purpose of each activity was for the mission trip\r\n 	Training began 4 months before we actually left. KCM is a UC-campus wide organization and students from all the different UC campuses would meet every Sunday for a 3 hour training session that would include sermons and weekly quizzes on readings and memory verses we had assigned to us as homework. We had 3 “super Saturdays” that were full day events for our teams to engage in team building exercises and different preparation activities to train us for missions such as food challenges or a hike. In the last 2 weeks before we left, we had extremely intensive training days that were from 6am -5 pm every day in which we learned body worship and skits. \r\n4.	Who/How was your team, its dynamics, and your interactions with other members\r\nMy team was a mix of 7 guys and 7 girls from all different UC campuses and all different ages. It was difficult getting to know everyone at first and the dynamics were pretty awkward because everyone seemed to want to gain everyone else’s approval. This turned into creating some superficial relationships. Our team definitely bonded more during retreat which was when we were able to actually spend more time with one another and get to know each other. Before then, it was really hard just seeing everyone once a week for a couple hours. \r\nEvery individual had a certain “task” and I was the photographer for the team. Other than that, I didn’t play too large of a role individually because I was of the youngest people in our entire team. I felt like I didn’t really have much a voice to offer and often withdrew when I felt like that someone else could lead the team. I was a team member and tried to do what I could as part of the team. Every member had a part in skits or participated in body worship. \r\n5.	What were your feelings leading up to this point of the training process?\r\nI was extremely nervous and actually was questioning this entire trip. I felt really out of place in my team and although I was excited, it was a surge of different emotions. I didn’t know what to expect and I was just anticipating the month to come.  \r\n6.	How did you prepare the funds for the trip?\r\nI raised $4,000 through writing support letters and sending them out to people in my church and friends at school as well. Also, CCM my ministry was able to offer support money for me as well. \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n7.	How was the lifestyle different in this country than in America?\r\nUganda’s a 3rd world country so it was definitely more rural and less modernized than America. Everything was literally two colors: red and green. All the roads were filled with red dirt and everything else around was full of green trees and green fields. It was absolutely gorgeous. Dirty, but gorgeous. The people that we would meet were extremely poor and although they would invite us into their house, their homes were essentially a shack with dirt floors.\r\n8.	What did you do while you were on missions? (specifics)\r\na.	Describe various instances/events \r\nWe travelled to 4 different cities, spend about a week in each place and during our time there, we would visit different schools, elementary schools, secondary schools, and also different churches and a couple prisons. We would essentially perform for them. They called the Uganda mission team the “rockstar ministry” because that what we were. To these people, we were rockstars and we would perform different skits and body worships for them. With a translator, one person would share their testimony and another person would share the gospel message. \r\n\r\n9.	What kinds of people did you interact with/meet?\r\nThe missionaries that we stayed with were full time Korean missionaries that have lived there for over 10 years. They housed us and organized our schedule for where to visit in Uganda. For each city we stayed in, we would stay at native Ugandan pastor’s homes and we would interact with the people there in their homes and the people of their church and their children as well. \r\na.	How did you interact with the indigenous people\r\nBecause of the language barrier it was definitely hard but the slight English they were able to speak was enough for us engage in conversation with them. With the children, we would just play with them. \r\n10.	Explain the daily ritual of a day overseas.\r\nWe would wake up at 6am every morning and have team Bible reading and devotional time. We would then wash up and have breakfast and get ready to go out to our first school. We would go to about 2-3 schools every day in which we did the same skits and same body worships repeatedly. We usually ended the day at around 6 where we would come back and have dinner. We would have some down time, end the day with devotionals and go to sleep. \r\n11.	What was the most memorable thing about missions\r\nThe most memorable part was just being able to experience this completely different lifestyle that I never would’ve known about firsthandedly. Just seeing the different people that were so passionate about their faith and seeing how these native people were so passionate in their faith and so willing to share the gospel when they are the minority in Uganda, it was so encouraging to see as a Christian myself. \r\n12.	Did you have small group, accountability, EV partners, etc? Describe those.\r\nWe did have small groups within our team although we only met a few times. We also had EV partners which were paired up 1 guy and 1 girl and we would travel together when we evangelized into the neighborhoods. In the last week, we had rotating partners with guys and girls for us to get to know each other a little better. \r\na.	How was team interaction at this point?\r\nOur team had conflict because there were apparently issues that between different members and it was clear how disunited our team was at this point. Our team leader called for a reconciliation time during the midpoint of our trip when that was supposed to be done at the end. We each then were supposed to have a one-on-one with everyone on our team to reconcile any differences we might have had and to overcome those differences for the rest of the trip. \r\n13.	What were some specific challenges that you had face? Both personal and eternal. \r\nPersonally, I had a hard time with my team. They were very hard for me to get along with and even now, I don’t really keep in close touch with them. Also, because the trip was so long, I got homesick and I was missing everyone from home.\r\na.	The hardest part of missions?\r\nThe hardest part was being in a new environment that I wasn’t used, surrounded by people that I didn’t know very well, engaging in tiring activities that really drained me physically by the end of the day.\r\nb.	The easiest part of missions?\r\nWas performing these skits and body worships. Because we had practiced so much and prepared intensely beforehand, it was easy to just do another performance again. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n14.	How did you feel after the trip was over? \r\nI felt really weird… like I couldn’t get around the fact that I was finally back. I missed America so much and wanted to go home so badly, but I really missed Uganda and it felt like the entire month was just a dream. I was slightly regretful because I felt like there was so much more that I wanted to do and experience but I wasn’t able to. I was thankful for the experience and during our retreat, I was able to really realize how great of an experience it really was. \r\n\r\n15.	Did the missions experience just end once you came back to America? If not, what kind of things did you have to engage in Why?\r\nThe week after we came back, we had a week of debriefing retreat where we met up with all the other teams that went out and we were able to share about our missions experience and debrief how the entire thing was. We heard testimonies from other teams and had reconciliation team with our team again. Also, when I came back, it was just as important to share about my experience to those especially that supported me. They had financed me on this trip and it wasn’t just for fun but to carry out God’s work. They deserve to know how God taught me and did so much for me on the trip. \r\n16.	How did mission supporters play a role in your overall experience?\r\nThey helped so much because they gave me all the financial support that I needed and I know that their prayers were so helpful for my entire experience. \r\n17.	If you could take one thing from your experience, what would it be? \r\nThat God works in such a greater way that I could never know.\r\n18.	Would you go overseas again for missions? Why or why not.\r\nYes! I definitely would. As difficult and challenging the entire trip was, it was so rewarding and it is something I will always look back on for the rest of my life. I would love to go back and see all the missionaries and wonderful that we met again.

I started playing in middle school and liked it right away.\r\nINT: Where did you play?\r\nHJ: I would usually play at PC Bangs [Korean internet cafes/LAN gaming centers]. The PC Bangs were very cheap, sometimes only $1 for an hour.\r\nINT: What’s the longest time someone would spend at the PC Bangs?\r\nHJ: Gamers might play for up to 10 hours.\r\nINT: Why do you think Starcraft has been able to be so popular in Korea?\r\nHJ: Everyone has Starcraft. Even though everyone in Korea is able to pirate the game, everyone still bought it. I think it sold more copies in Korea than America. Also, Korea has pros which made the game very popular.\r\nINT: Did you look up to any of these pros?\r\nHJ: Slayer Boxer [Korean Starcraft Pro], because of his amazing play and his incredible fan base.\r\nINT: What do others think of Boxer?\r\nHJ: He has many fans, almost like a rock star here. I saw him once on TV years ago and he was with his parents and he confessed that he played 12 hours a day. Even though Boxer is very famous and rich, millions of other Koreans play Starcraft and haven’t been so lucky.\r\nINT: Are there any non-Korean pros?\r\nHJ: There is only one, Huk [a Canadian who has moved to Korea to play professionally].\r\nINT: Do Korean girls play Starcraft or is it only guys?\r\nHJ: Korean girls usually don’t play Starcraft, but many are fans who follow the players, especially Boxer.\r\nINT: What do Koreans think of normal Starcraft players?\r\nHJ: It is very different in Korea. In the U.S, if you play Starcraft people think you are a nerd, but if you don’t play in Korea, you are a nerd because that means you don’t do anything outside of school. Starcraft is what we talk about all day in Korea, not just when you play.\r\nINT: How do people socialize over Starcraft outside the game?\r\nHJ: You might just relate to someone over what race they play [there are four “races” players can choose from in Starcraft]. If you don’t play Starcraft, it means you can’t socialize.\r\nINT: Will Korea continue to be the dominant Starcraft country?\r\nHJ: Starcraft is changing, more countries are becoming better and more involved with the game, but Korea has a huge population, and Koreans may stay better because they have more experience and have been playing at a higher level for a longer period of time.\r\nINT: Are Koreans better at Starcraft?\r\nHJ: I think Koreans have more dedication and concentration for the game. People play for hours and hours every day.\r\nINT: How do Korean Starcraft players see each other?\r\nHJ: There is actually some anger between Starcraft I and Starcraft II players.

Explain what motivated your decision to go overseas\r\nMore of like its like you don’t know if you’re ready but if you don’t start how would you ever know that you are ready so take action I guess. Ready for anything I guess in general and in this case, for service. I remember my mom was like do you want to go on missions and I thought should I and I thought about it and if  I don’t know if I will ever be ready why don’t I take the first step and find out. \r\n3.	Explain what the training process entails\r\nIt’s like we split into groups and we prepared in groups and had introduction courses to the goals and who we were going to work with and stuff like.\r\nThe goals were like getting to know the people that we were going to work with and so we worked with university students and trying to get to know them better and stuff like that. \r\nMeet every Wednesday and prepared like activities. We read a book but I don’t remember the name of the book. \r\na.	Make sure to note what the purpose of each activity was for the mission trip\r\nWhat happened was we had to visit different places like orphanages or beach resort and we would play activities for orphanage for kids but beach would be like lectures and like stuff like that and got to know each other. \r\n4.	Who/How was your team, its dynamics, and your interactions with other members\r\nHad 2 parts: youth and a lot of like parents but the thing is the parents’ goals were not the same as ours: they went to visit indigenous places while we went to university students so we didn’t work with them at all so the students I worked with were mostly like seniors graduating high school and we all knew each other pretty well because we were in the same youth group anywasy in church and grew up with each other so it was really easy to work with each other. Our leader was pretty old like 30 and he also knew us so it was pretty chill\r\nHe wasn’t actively engaged in activities but more to make sure nothing went wrong and we ran it. \r\na.	What is the role of the team leader \r\nb.	What was your role in the team\r\nOne of the older ones.  Not really a leadership role because the students we were working with were our translators and the students when we went to Vietnam were older than us so it was more like not like a leader defined cause we saw each other as peers. \r\n\r\n5.	What were your feelings leading up to this point of the training process? \r\n6.	How did you prepare the funds for the trip?\r\nOur church subsidizes a lot and the only thing I had to pay for was the airplane fare. They subsidized and considering what we do, it costs quite a lot. I think it ‘s at least $50,000 for like at least 15 students and a lot of Vietnamese students. Like 25 students total\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n7.	How was the lifestyle different in this country than in America?\r\nFirst of all, we start at like 5am cuz the sun is up by 4:30 and it’s down by 5 pm. Everything is shifted up by like 4 hours. The first things I noticed was the climate: it was freaking humid. The instance you get off the plane it was bad and it was also very crowded. Espeicially traffic and stuff there wasn’t a lot of cars but a lot of scooters and not as orderly. Meals and stuff were freaking cheap. I remember went to the best pho place and a bowl of pho is like $.99. \r\n \r\n8.	What did you do while you were on missions? (specifics)\r\na.	Describe various instances/events \r\nWe went to an orphanage and cleaned up and did activities with them and then afterwards we went to the beach resort just with the university students to get to know them and that was our 2 main things. The university students knew English and we could ask others to translate. \r\n9.	What kinds of people did you interact with/meet?\r\nMost of them were not Christian- they are more repressive but more lenient than China. The government doesn’t care about the people but against foreigners but don’t care about what the natives. Not really have to do it secretly because once you get to know them, I don’t know just don’t be stupid about it \r\na.	How did you interact with the indigenous people\r\n10.	Explain the daily ritual of a day overseas.\r\nYou wake up, eat breakfast, a lot of packing cause you move a lot. There were 2 phases: at the orphanage you do a lot and at the resort its very chill. We would go back by like 5pm and after 5 it’s like free time and went around the city and visited places and by 9 you’re freaking tired. It’s like serving but at the same time it is evangelizing through actions cause you can’t really, we had problems with the police in the area before so we can’t explicitly evangelize. \r\n11.	What was the most memorable thing about missions\r\n12.	Did you have small group, accountability, EV partners, etc? Describe those.\r\na.	How was team interaction at this point?\r\nAfter the end of the day, we stayed at like a motel and within our rooms we would have reflection. We reflect on what we did and what we did wrong and have bible study and praise. \r\n13.	What were some specific challenges that you had face? Both personal and eternal. \r\na.	The hardest part of missions?\r\nb.	The easiest part of missions?\r\nIt wasn’t really hard for me because I’m in the mode to suck it up so if anything did seem difficult than I would get over it pretty fast. But it was pretty annoying that if you wore clothes for the rest of the day they were gone for the rest of the trip cuz you sweat so much. I don’t get stressed out anyways cuz that’s my personality. I know for sure there conflicts with some of the guys cause one of the guys snores really loudly so some of the other guys would get frustrated. And mosquitos are crazy over there. \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n14.	How did you feel after the trip was over? \r\nI was exhausted. It was like surreal and very dreamlike so am I in reality. So I was like I don’t know, I was like out of it for like a week cause I also had to adjust so I just knocked out. I remember I came back and knock out on a chair. \r\n\r\n15.	Did the missions experience just end once you came back to America? If not, what kind of things did you have to engage in Why?\r\nWhen we came back ,we still kept in touch with the students and every now and then email them. The thing is, they will remember you forever and I remember this year, they would ask about the people that went last year. In Vietnam, there’s a lot of Koreans already. \r\nI’m not a sharing type but I felt the need to write about it but didn’t feel the need to share sort of because most of the sharing I did was over there. If they didn’t go, they would be the people I shared with anyways. \r\n\r\n16.	If you could take one thing from your experience, what would it be? \r\nThe 90 cent Pho. I’m just kidding. What I appreciated over there was it didn’t seem like they were trying to hide anything. It seemed like everything they did was genuine and no alterior motive to be with us even though we’re foreigners. \r\n\r\n17.	Would you go overseas again for missions? Why or why not.\r\nYeah, because there are several reasons. Lets see,…first of all I just want to travel and see other cultures but wouldn’t seem worthwhile to go for my own personal fulfillment. \r\n\r\nIt showed me that the resources I had to other people and sort of reminded me not to waste what I have sort of.

We met through mutual friends because we all played basketball. After hanging out a few times, we became friends and it eventually led to something more. \r\n\r\nG: Did your parents have any reaction to the news about your relationship with Troy?\r\nC: My parents are very Korean so I knew they would be very upset about me dating Troy. I kept it a secret for a year or so. I felt bad because Troy\'s parents knew about me from the start. His parents knew that my parents didn\'t know because of my Korean culture, but they understood. Troy was okay with it too. Once my parents found out I think it was my mom who was disappointed the most. Also I don\'t think my parents ever thought I would date someone other than Korean because I was always an obedient child. I think my parents had the idea that I wouldn\'t have told them about Troy if I wasn\'t considering marrying him. In the beginning my mom told me not to have any intention on marrying him, and to just stay friends. But eventually they accepted the fact that I was with Troy for the long run and they gave in. \r\n\r\nG: When you were planning the wedding, did you want to include any Korean traditions?\r\nC: I wanted to do paebaek but I didn\'t because it\'s mainly for the in-laws and my in-laws are not Korean. If I married a Korean guy, I would have done paebaek. Instead my mom got me and Troy matching hanbok so that we could wear it during the reception. It was important to me to have Troy connected with Korean culture because that is my culture. Troy was very open to the idea of wearing hanbok, and everyone got a good laugh seeing him in hanbok because he is 6\'2 and white.\r\n\r\nG: Imagine that you have children. Your daughter or son is about to get married. Do you want them to incorporate Korean wedding traditions into their wedding?\r\nC: I think it depends on the person and the circumstances. In my situation, I wanted to do paebaek which I think is something uncommon among my generation. I know a lot of my Korean girlfriends who would not do paebaek because it\'s too much work and it\'s not something that is necessary. I just thought it would be nice to do it because it\'s my culture and that is something important to me. But if I had kids…I would want my daughter to do paebaek and wear hanbok if she married a Korean man. I think my mom wanted me to marry a Korean man because it would be nice to do paebaek, because my mom would play a huge role in helping me do it. Also marrying a Korean guy would just be more convenient. I wouldn\'t force my child to do something Korean in their wedding if they didn\'t want to. It\'s something that I don\'t see often either, so I think it\'s more a leisure or fun thing to do.\r\n','','',0,0),(113,14,121,109,'Korean Exceptionalism','Fieldnotes','M - Michael Myung-hoon Lee; B - Hai Chun Jae; H - Interviewer.\r\n\r\nM considers himself 2nd generation because he immigrated to America at a very young age.

The grades from the ladder are very harsh, a player with a D+ rating on the ladder would beat any real friends.\r\nINT: How many hours a day would you play?\r\nJK: Freshman and sophomore year, I tried really hard to get to a C- rating. It was really addictive and I started doing really bad in school. I would play five or six hours a day and did really bad in GEs.\r\nINT: Why were you willing to try so hard for a good rating?\r\nJK: I saw an online video where people played really good. I played way too much. It got more and more addicting as I got better and better after playing more and more. I went too hard but I don’t have any regrets.\r\nINT: Have you had any other competitive Starcraft experience?\r\nJK: I was on the original UCLA pro league team, but I actually recruited someone who was much better and replaced me.\r\nINT: Do you think Koreans are inherently better at Starcraft?\r\nJK: They aren’t inherently better, they just play too much. While it is a combination of hard work and talent, I think hard work is more important than talent.\r\nINT: What do you think about professional Starcraft?\r\nJK: When I first started watching pro league, every match was amazing to watch. But now they are boring. All of the old tournaments are dying, and it is hard for teams to find good sponsors. Older tournaments used to be sponsored by companies like Korean Air and were sometimes held in aircraft carriers but this doesn’t really happen anymore.\r\nINT: What do you think of Slayer Boxer?\r\nJK: Everyone loved Boxer, he was unselfish and wanted to get sponsors for everyone and not only himself, he really created esports in Korea.\r\nINT: How do people in Korea train?\r\nJK: They eat, play, workout, play some more, and sleep. Then wake up and start again, they probably play 16 hours a day.\r\nINT: What do you of Starcraft II when compared to Starcraft I?\r\nJK: A lot of people don’t like Starcraft II because it is much easier. People who sucked at Starcraft I moved onto Starcraft II early to gain an advantage. The skillcap [the limit to how a player can perform] is much lower in Starcraft II. They also took out all of the cool units [the characters within the game which players use to fight each other].\r\nINT: Could you compare the difficulty of the two on a scale?\r\nJK: Starcraft I would be a 10, it is one of the hardest games ever made and Starcraft II would be a 6. In Starcraft I, it was impossible to hotkey [the ability to tie an action to an individual key].\r\nINT: Have you visited Korea before?\r\nJK: Once, a long time ago. I don’t remember much.\r\nINT: Do people know you are Korean when you play online?\r\nJK: No, I don’t have a Korean gamertag, I use joke names like “captainblowjob”.\r\nINT: Do you consider yourself part of the Korean community?\r\nJK: No, I’ve never really hung out with Koreans in Diamond Bar. All of my friends were either Chinese or Mexican.\r\nINT: How do you interact with friends within the game? \r\nJK: Friends will always mess around and try to cheese [win using frowned upon tactics] you. Whenever I get cheesed, it is very frustrating. I would rather lose in 40 minutes instead of 4 minutes.\r\nINT: What do Koreans think of Starcraft? What does it mean in Korea?\r\nJK: I think half of Korea loves that Starcraft is a national sport and the other half is embarrassed. My own parents are embarrassed by it. It is a little ridiculous that a video game is a national sport. Korea is the nerdiest country in the world.\r\nINT: Do you have any funny Starcraft stories to share?\r\nJK: When Toss Girl [one of the few female Korean players] lost to Idra [an American Starcraft player] she supposedly cried because she felt like she lost national pride. Also, players like “Survivor” have gone to court and jail because they fixed matches. Starcraft is serious business in Korea. I heard that the judge called him worse than a child molester, but I’m not sure if that was true. \r\nINT: How do players train?\r\nJK: Players are trying to achieve mechanical perfection. The skill cap is so low that there is no chance to win with bad mechanics. \r\nINT: Why do people stop playing Starcraft? What do pros do after?\r\nJK: Some players have to stop because of carpal tunnel and others just become too old to be players. Some might go back to school or enter the Starcraft business through coaching or running tournaments.\r\nINT: Do you plan to play Starcraft in the future? What do you play now?\r\nJK: There is zero change of me playing Starcraft II in the future. I really don’t like it anymore. I only play Super Smash Brothers Melee now, I am one of the top 15 players in the world.

Shin was very informative in many aspects of Korean dream culture. The information that he gave me will help a lot with my hypothesis. I transcribed most of the information, but skipped through some of the less important details. Here is the information:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m here with Shin lee asking about Korean dream questions. All right, so here we go Shin. So what kind of dreams would be considered good dreams in like Korean culture?\r\n\r\nSo are you talking about Korean society; Like the Korean society looks at good dreams?\r\n\r\nWhat animals would be considered good in Korean culture?\r\n\r\nAre you skipping the dream part?\r\n\r\nThat’s involving the dream…considered good dreams. Like, what things in dreams consider them to be good. Whether it be like animals, or certain objects, or certain actions that are done.\r\n\r\nOh, I see what you mean by dream. So you are actually talking about the dream that we actually dream not like what we actually want to be. Okay, so that kinda of dream we consider as good as…if you see a dog in your dream that’s such a bad luck.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nJust so…\r\n\r\nWhat, does the dog have to be doing any specific action?\r\n\r\nThere’s no really action to consider. However, in Korean culture and language we use dogs in always bad ways. So every time, you say dog in Korean and put “seki” that becomes a bad word. So every time that you say dog related becomes harming, negative connotation, it has. \r\n\r\nWhat other animals would be for dreams?\r\n\r\nSo there are few types of major animals that we consider good for dreams. The first one is pig, if you see a pig in your dream that means you’re going to get some kind of luck charm from the pig in your dream. So people usually in Korea they buy a lottery ticket.\r\n\r\nDo they do anything else besides buy a lottery ticket? Do they go and play...like gamble?\r\n\r\nBut poker and gamble is not really legal in Korea…\r\n\r\nBut you guys do it anyways?\r\n\r\nBut we do it anyways\r\n\r\nWhat objects are considered good? Like if you dream golden coins or some type of object.\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNone? Like if you dream about water something’s going to happen with you…\r\n\r\n…So there are some people that talk about the saw a fish coming out of the water, or a dragon comes out of the water and goes to the sky then people think that’s some type of dream that gives you a kid for you to get pregnant. So for example, if you’re relative have a dream or something like that out of water… that means someone your relative or you or your wife may have gotten pregnant. \r\n\r\nIs there any action in dreams that would be considered bad or good? Like if you were to climb a man and you just climbing and there was no end, is that a sign for something?\r\n\r\nI think those kind of dreams are common to any country...(skip). If you kill the dog in your dream for example, that means that you will kill away the negative happenings in your life. But if that doesn’t end that just means that you’re going end up in hell in your life. \r\n\r\nSo, you’re saying if you try killing a dog in your dream the dogs ends up living you’re just pretty much gonna go to hell or you’re going to have a bad life?\r\n\r\nBad life. \r\n\r\n(Skip)\r\n\r\nNow you’ve mentioned dreams with pigs bring fortune and then dogs bring bad luck. What about dragons? If there is anything you know about dragons.\r\n\r\nActually, dragons are very good luck. Like long time ago in Ancient times of Korea, like in Korean dynasty if you have a dream about a dragon it’s in relation to the royal family. So basically, the Queen had dream about dragon and “oh, I’m going to have the next king of this dynasty/kingdom” that’s how it became. So it’s very highly… like if you have a dream then it’s like superior thing. \r\n\r\n(Skip)\r\n\r\nAnd for my last question. Did your mom or one of your relatives have a dream about you before you were born? \r\n\r\nI don’t know that much about my mother…but we have our tradition of…so for example, if your wife is pregnant and then I, as a friend, had a dream that maybe because of the pregnancy oh I saw a dragon in my dream but like there was you in there and then that dragon was going into your womb or something and then boom the next day you call me and you’re pregnant something like that.  And then if my dream was the cause then you have buy my dream.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by “buy”?\r\n\r\nThat’s cultural thing. Okay I dream your wife is pregnant; I told you that. and then you have to buy my dream so that your kid can grow nice. \r\n\r\nREALLY?! Does that really happen?\r\n\r\nYeah, that even comes out in Korean dramas. \r\n\r\n(Skip)\r\n\r\nAnyways, back to my original question. So your mom or relatives have never had any dreams about someone being born. \r\n\r\nI don’t really remember correctly…I just remember that from my memory…but, I think my mother or one of my other relatives had dream about a carp, fish, like they got it from the lake, huge carp, that also is considered pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAnd then who was born?\r\n\r\nAnd then I was born.\r\n\r\nOh you were born?\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n(Skip) \r\n\r\nAnd then right after my mom got pregnant. My grandfather went to fish carp and caught huge carp. \r\n\r\nWait, so after your mom had the dream he went fishing and caught a huge carp? Crazy.\r\n\r\nSo he came back with that carp, cooked it and gave it to my mother. \r\n\r\n<END>\r\n','Shin Lee Korean Dream.mp3','audio/mpeg',1714718,1685486),(130,64,130,121,'Korean Dream Project 2','Audio','Data was collected at Profeta Cafe.

And, dreams with dragons means there is gonna be some kind of success in your life...in your career. I think that’s about it, dreams about your ancestors usually are good dreams as well.\r\n\r\nWhat about objects in your dreams? Like any type of objects.\r\n\r\nObjects? Well, I’m not too sure. I know that if there’s treasure, that’s for sure good. And traveling international\r\n\r\nWhat about snakes? \r\n\r\nI personally think it’s really bad. But, I’m not too sure about other Koreans. Cause I also have the Korean Christian background.\r\n\r\nWell what about that dream that you told me about your family friend having the dream about the snake skin?\r\n\r\nYeah, but that one was a good one. Cause the snakeskin pulled off but the skin was actually made out of diamonds. Made out of little diamond strings. So like, it kinda represents something good. It’s not like (too loud to hear)\r\n\r\nIs there is any specific action?\r\n\r\nIt’s never good to do running. \r\n\r\nRunning? Why is that?\r\n\r\nIt is like you are trying to escape from something bad. And obviously…oh going back to objects: fire! It’s like really bad.\r\n\r\nWhy is fire bad? \r\n\r\nBecause it just represents something bad, okay!\r\n\r\nWhat about dogs in dreams?\r\n\r\nDog for animals is bad luck. Dogs are always bad. \r\n\r\n(Skip) 2:30-4:00\r\n\r\nNow the main question. Do you have a birth dream that your mother or o relatives have had about you before you were born?\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, mine was a really good one. It was actually cherry blossom tree moving (hard to hear can’t tell if it was moving or something else) and then two doves flying away…no it was three doves. \r\n\r\nWas the tree growing?\r\n\r\nNo, it was just like a full blooming cherry blossom tree. I can’t remember if my mom says if they were landing or it was just flying. \r\n\r\nWhat your siblings? Like your sister and brother?\r\n\r\nYeah, my brother’s dream was also really good. My mom went to a pond and there was three koi fish, like one black and two orange ones. Like they were really pretty. And then she actually grabbed all three with her hand.\r\n\r\nWere they swimming around each other?\r\n\r\nYeah, they were like swimming around. And then my mom picked up the three of them. And then she woke up.\r\n\r\nWhat about your sister’s?\r\n\r\nI’m not too sure if it’s a good dream or if it’s bad. But, it also has flowers. There were roses and some sort of vegetable flower; I don’t even think I can remember…I think it was a lettuce vegetable flower. Anyways, I think it was blooming and that was it.\r\n\r\nWas there anything significance with the number?\r\n\r\nYeah, all the dreams my mom had there were three things. I think my sister’s dream had two lettuce flowers and one rose… or the other way around. And my brothers was two orange fish and one black one. And for me it was three doves. \r\n\r\nDo you think that number would represent you, your sister, and your brother?\r\n\r\nYeah, that’s what my mom thinks. Especially in my brothers dream…\r\n\r\nSo, I was talking to other people and they said that also, if you have dream about a dragon coming out of the water. It signifies male and that they’ll be a strong leader. Have you heard that before?\r\n\r\nYeah, cause like Korea there is this myth about like there is a stage between a snake and dragon. I don’t think there is this myth in Chinese and Japanese culture, I asked my professors and they don’t know. But there is like this huge half dragon of half snake that lives underwater one when it reaches 500 years or 1000 years it can become a dragon and ride up to the heavens.\r\n\r\n(Skip) 7:27-9:00\r\n\r\nSo, I’ve received other information saying that if someone is close to your family had a dream about someone in your family and there dream was a good dream, you’re suppose to buy the dream from them. \r\n\r\nYeah, I heard about the tradition before, but we don’t do that.\r\n\r\n(Skip) 9:25-10:41 \r\n\r\n<END>\r\n','In He Jung Korean Dream Project.mp3','audio/mpeg',1158934,1687754),(131,19,-1,122,'Korean Seaweed Soup 1A','Fieldnotes','KOREAN 183: KOREAN FOLKLORE\r\nField-Assignment \r\nSeaweed Soup – Culinary Practices  \r\n\r\nCollector: Sin Hye (Cindy) Lee\r\nInterviewee: Esther Yoo\r\nRelationship: Friend\r\nDate Recorded: 2/20/2012 (Monday)\r\nRecorded Length – 15 Minutes 56 Seconds \r\n\r\nContext: Interview session was held in the main gathering room of interviewee’s father’s church during the afternoon (approximately around 3PM). We sat across from each other at a table and placed the recorder in between us. There was no one else at church. You can hear the sounds of the cars in the street but it was not enough to be distracting. The mood was fairly quiet and private. However, interviewee was getting sick and had a runny nose. The environment was engaging. There were no immediate distractions.  \r\n\r\nC: Ok. So I’m just going interview you really quickly something about 미역. Ok? So, my first question is: What is seaweed soup or 미역국 to you? \r\nI: Seaweed soup is a traditional, um, that Korean people eat on their birthdays. And what’s made of it is dried seaweed. You make a broth out of it with different types of food. You can make like a beef broth, anchovy broth, or a different type of seaweed broth called 다시마. I mean, there are different varieties of it. It’s like lots of…there’s like dried seaweed in it and you can add like any vegetables you want. \r\nC: Ok, so that’s seaweed soup. So, uh, like you mentioned that on birthday but what other special occasions do you eat 미역국?\r\nI: Uh, I only heard of it that you eat it on your birthday. I don’t know…\r\nC: Any other..?\r\n	I: what the whole tradition is regarding it. \r\nC: Uh-huh.\r\nI: But, um, it’s actually…yea, it’s just…a lot of people talk about eating it on their birthday. So I actually eat it on my birthday. But, you could also eat it as a like-a side-dish kind of. \r\nC: Ok, when you do you make…No. No. No. How do you make your 미역국 and what do you put in, what do you take out, and what’s your version of 미역국? \r\nI: Uh, for me, I just found the recipe online and I tried to make it. I actually made it for my friend’s birthday couple years ago. I think, maybe, 3 to 4 years ago for the first time. It is actually pretty good, pretty simple. So for what I did was…I bought like, um, these…I don’t know what type of beef it was, but I just went to a Korean market and I went to the meat section and asked them what kind of meat do I put in for 미역국. And then they just gave me like a buck of meat. So, what I did was I slicked up the meat very small, like bite-size. Then I would sauté it with pepper and little bit of sesame oil. And then, on the side, I would make anchovy broth…\r\nC: Ok. \r\nI: and I would pour the broth in there. But then, before I start all that I would get the dried seaweed and put it in a bowl of water. What do you call that? Uh, I don’t know how to explain it cause they are dried but the…you put it in water and…\r\nC: Kind of like, soak it, I guess. \r\nI: Yea, yea. I soak it just to make it not-dried. HAHA I don’t know how to describe it, but yeah… (Laughs) I would put it in the water and then I pour the broth into the sautéed meat. I would put in my seaweed and then, I would just boil it. And I would add like other ingredients like garlic, sesame oil, there is a base (like a soy sauce base) called 국 간장, I will put that in. Then, I would put like…this other, uh, not sure if I would call it spice but I put 소고기 다시마.  \r\nC: OK. \r\nI: It kind of has like sodium in it. It actually kind-of makes it a little better. And then, I just boil it for like a good 10 minutes and it will be good. \r\nC: And that’s it? \r\nI: Yea, and sometimes I also put like seaweed, I mean, seafood in there. I buy it, wash it up, and throw it in there to add more flavors.\r\nC: You can speak in Korean too if you want. Yea, you can mix and match… or you can speak whatever is comfortable for you. \r\n	I: Oh, ok. Yea, it’s kind of hard to describe it. \r\nC: Oh, let’s see. So who taught you how to make 미역국? \r\nI: I actually learned it by myself. I mean, I see my mom make 미역국 a lot and I always helped her on the side when she made not only 미역국 but also other traditional Korean food. But then, I actually looked up the recipe because I kind of like cooking. So I found the recipe and made it for myself. \r\nC: How old were you when you first learned it?\r\nI: I think I was 19.\r\nC: 19? When you first made it by yourself? \r\nI: Yea, when I first learned it by myself. 	 \r\nC: Um, let’s see…in the past, who generally made 미역국 for you? Was there only one person or multiple people? \r\nI: There were multiple people. There was like my mom and grandma and mostly we would eat 미역국 at churches, just like on Sundays. \r\nC: Um, how did your mom make미역국?\r\n	I: My mom….\r\nC: From what you can remember. \r\nI: She would make it with either beef broth or anchovy broth. One of her specialty recipe is instead of using regular water; she would use water from rice. Like, when she makes new rice, she would first wash it the first time. When she pours water in…when she is making rice, she would use the second water, and use it as the special recipe when she makes it. \r\nC: Really? I didn’t know you could do that. So do you know how your grandma makes it? \r\nI: I don’t know how she does it?\r\nC: How come you don’t try and make it with your mom’s special recipe? \r\nI: Um, I actually did try once but I don’t know, I just kind of liked mine better. Cause when she makes it is kind of 신거워, which is better for your health but I am young, I like 짠 and salty foods. \r\nC: Um, do you have any…what are some of your memories or experiences of  미역국 as you are growing up? What did…do you have any stories about미역국? \r\nI: When I think about미역국, the first person that comes into my head is my best friend, Vivian, and her mom. because I love her mom’s미역국, which is my favorite of all times. I don’t know how she make sit but it is just so unique to my taste that I really like it. \r\nC: Oh, but you don’t know what it is?\r\nI: My friend, Vivian, told me that she puts a lot of garlic in it. But that’s all I know. (Laughs) And it is like my favorite. I grew up with Vivian so whenever I go to her house, she always has 미역국 so when I think about미역국, I always think about her. \r\nC: How many…this is kind of a funny question but how many times do you think you had미역국 in your life? \r\nI: Well…I’m 23 this year, so I am pretty sure I ate more than 23 times. Um, I say I would times 23 by 10 because I am pretty sure I at least eat 10미역국 within a year. I am turning 23 so I would times it by that much. \r\nC: And why is미역국 so meaningful for you, like the actually dish and what kind of meaning does it carry for you?\r\nI: I think it is just a really healthy food. I don’t know if you can actually get sick of it. I don’t know but it is a really healthy food you can eat when you are hungry and you have nothing else to eat at home. If you have like the basic ingredient…if you have a variety of food at home. \r\nC: So it is healthy?\r\nI: Yes, it is very healthy. \r\nC: When you think of미역국, what does it represent to you? Anything that comes to your mind…\r\n	I: My culture. \r\nC: Your culture, healthy…is that it? \r\nI: Health…and I don’t know what else to say it, but I mean it is one of the traditional Korean food and I will be proud of it to 알려저 미역국 as a Korean. \r\nC: So you’re a Korean American right? Are you a 2nd generation? \r\n	I: I don’t know how it works. \r\nC: or 1.5?\r\n	I: It’s like really confusing.\r\nC: What do you consider yourself?\r\nI: I consider myself as a 1st generation just because I was born here. I don’t know, a lot of people say different stuff when it comes to that, which generation are you because when people say when your parents land here…when they come from their background to America, they are the first from their family to come to America so they’re the 1st generation and their kid is 2nd generation. But I feel like if you’re born here, I should mean that you are 1st generation but I don’t know…I just consider myself a 1st generation because I am the first Korean American born from my family. \r\nC: Oh, Ok. Why do you think you continue doing this…you know, why do you think you keep making 미역국 right now in America? Why do you think you do that?\r\nI: I mean, I think it is just like a Korean culture whether you are in American or in another country. I think it is a Korean culture thing that they do. You make it for your birthday. I don’t know the specific meaning behind it but, I don’t know…I would do that too. \r\nC: Would you teach your, like when you grow up and have a family, would you want to teach your kids how to make 미역국?\r\nI: Yes, definitely. Maybe if they want to learn by themselves too. Like me, I found the recipe. Nobody actually taught me how to make it. I just heard that you eat this on your birthday and I actually made it for my friend for the first time. I mean, if my kids want to learn it I would teach them. \r\nC: do you feel closer to your Korean heritage by making미역국? Do you feel like…you mentioned earlier…like you have Korean pride (a little bit of it) that you can all resemble to it, make you closer to your Korean heritage? \r\nI: I think, I can’t specifically say just 미역국 or just Korean culture…anything that has to do with getting close to it. Like 김치 and미역국 or all these other food sand entertainment draws me closer to it. \r\nC: And if you were to rank미역국 as a Korean dish, where would you rank it from 1-10? How important is it from 1-10? \r\n	I: I say 10. \r\nC: 10? Oh, why is it 100% important to you?\r\nI: Because, I don’t know…just we have a special background to it. Even though I don’t know too much detail but just hearing that it is good to eat for your birthday…like it’s spreading a lot these days. Even foreigners in Korea, they make it for their significant others on their birthday too…like in Korea. I think it is just really…no, I think it’s cute too but I think how important it is in Korean culture that even foreigners are willing to make a food that is not from their country but to make it for someone else. \r\nC: Do you think that미역국is a little bit more efficient because it is easier to make than 김치 because 김치 is intensely hard to make.  	\r\nI: Yea, 김치 is very hard to make but I think it is a different category. I know it’s in the same Korean food and dish but, um, 김치 is widely known. When someone speaks of 김치, they automatically think of Korean people - just how sushi is with Japanese people. But with미역국it is not as widely known as 김치but I guess it differs. (Sniffles/ Coughs) \r\nC: If you can…just randomly, if you can think of any information you want to tell me…extra information you want to tell me about미역국or you want to add anything…anything? \r\n	I: No, well I do kind of have a question. But, I was wondering why you chose미역국as a topic.\r\nC: Oh, why I chose it? Well I was looking into…for our Korean folklore class, we have to choose anything that Koreans do as a tradition. But traditional could be anything from like 2 people doing it, to a family doing it, to the whole nation doing it. \r\n	I: I know. \r\nC: As long as like two or more people share kind of same action and meaning to it. Thinking about it, there are a lot of different things. But I started thinking…actually Vivian made미역국 for Yon Wook and that kind of got me thinking…like why is it so special for people want to make미역국? Like, what is the meaning behind it? I don’t know…I never thought about it. Being Korean, I wondered too…like why? Why is it so special? If you didn’t get미역국, would you be sad? If no one made you미역국, would you be sad?\r\nI: I think if I didn’t get미역국on my birthday like once in my life, I think I would be sad. I think there are people who never ate미역국 on their birthday. \r\nC: So, it means that much right? \r\nI: Yea.\r\nC: It almost makes you feel important and loved…it’s a sign of affection. \r\nI: Yea, to show that you are celebrating someone’s birthday  by making미역국 for someone…so you feel loved…\r\nC: That’s why I want to do it.

But I think celebrating the birth of someone is important too. \r\nC: Yea, they are two separate celebrations.

We went into one room and sat on the bed since there was no other space available. The room was quite dark due to minimal lighting. Several family members were in the living room watching Korean drama. The sounds traveled into the room and were somewhat distracting; however, the interview was still manageable. At one point, In Ju Ko’s husband came home during the middle of the interview and announced that he was home. The mood was slightly hectic, but besides the two distracting elements, the interview went smoothly. \r\n\r\nC: 사장님, 그러면요…사장님은 미역국이 모라고 생각해요? \r\nI: 미역국은 우리 한국 사람들이, 여자들이 특히 애를 낳고…아무래도 미역이 피를 맑에 해주니까, 애기 낫을때 여자들 한탠 좋은거지. 그렇니깐, 미역국은 한국 사람들 한태는…보통 생일날 미역극을 많이 먹는대, 그거는 꼭 애기를 낳고 나서 항상 여자들이 몸을 보호하고 피를 맑에 해서…혈핵수난을 잘 하기 의에서, 그래서 미역국을 먹그등, 항상. 그래서…그게 애기를 나았은때 그거를 많이 먹으니깐…거히 대부분은 미역국을 많이 먹으니깐, 옛날 부터…그렇기 때문에…생일때는 다 미역국을 끄려 먹는거지.  \r\nC: 그리고, 어…사장님은여 미역국을 어덯게 만드새요? 사장님 만에 STYLE?\r\nI: 네 STYLE이라는 거는 따를거 없어. 보통들 보면…모 어떤 사람은 참기름에 복까서 만드는 사람이 있고, 어떤 사람은 좋은 고기로 해서 만드는 사람이 있고, 어떤 사람은 거기다가 해물을 넣서 만드는 사람…다 지역 마다 쪼금씩 미역국 만드는 식이 다른대. 나 같은 경후는 그냥 모…아무 것도 않 놓고, 미역에다가…어, 그냥 마늘 쫌 많이 놓고…끄리는 거지. 깔끔하게… \r\nC: 해물 같은 것도 않 놓고…?\r\nI: 응,그것도 않 놓고, 그냥 깔끔하게…마늘만 좀 놓고. 그렇게 깔끔하게 끄려.\r\nC: 그리고…사장님은 미역국을 언재 배우 셨어요? 어터케 만드지?\r\nI: 언제 누구 한태 딱히 배웟기 보다도…그냥, 책 보고 배운거 같에. 책 보고나…인재 또 엄마가 끄럿을때. 그냥 이렇게…모 보통들 생일때 많이 먹으니깐 주로. 생일때 봏면 고기 놓고 끄린 다던가…그래서 모 쫌 따른거는따른것도 그렇 치만, 그냥…다른 사람들 한태 듯고, 하고, 모 책에서 보고…그렇게 끄린거…\r\nC: 처음 했던 TIME  기역 하새요?\r\nI: 처음 끄렸을 때는…기억은 않 나는대. 모 딱히 말하자면…결혼 하구 나서 아무래도 살림 해게 되니깐, 그렇게서  끄리게 시작한 거야.\r\nC: 그렇고…사장님은 전에 미역국을 드셨을 때는요…대부분 누가 미역국을 끄러 줬어요, 사장님 한태?\r\nI: 엄마가 많이 끄려 줬지 주로. 아빠는 그런거 잘 않 했는대…주로 엄마가 많이 끄려 주지. \r\nC: 사장님은 단순하게 만들 잖아요…그렇면, 왜 단순하게 만드는지. 아니면, 어머니 하고 많이 달라요, 미역국 만드는게?\r\nI: 그렇치, 엤날에는 생일때만, 모 고기 넣고 끄리니깐…그랬는대. 지금은 그렇지가 않는대.\r\n(THIRD PARTY = “여버, 나 왔어!” - DISTRACTION) \r\n그, 미역을 끄리는…그…저기할때…모…근대, 고기가 좋지 않으니깐…우리 몸에. 그리고 예내 아빠가 아파서…아픈 다음 부터는 고기를 많이 쭈리는 경후 라서, 고기를 않 놓고 끄리기 시작 하니깐 더 깔끔 한거 갓더라고. 옛날에는 사람들이 거히 고기 놓고 하는대…모 해물 같은거 놓로 끄리는 사람들이…그런거 먹어 보니깐, 오히려 더 깔끔하고 맛있더라고. 그렇게는 않해 봤지만…고기를 않 느고 끄려도 미역국이 맛있어.  \r\nC: 아…그렇고요, 사장님은 어렸을 때 부터 미역국을 먹어 왔잔아요, 근대 그중에서 딱히 기역 나느거, 특별한 모 미역국 대에서 사연 뫃 이런거 있으새요? \r\nI: 미역국 대에서 사연은 없지만…대부분 엄마들이, 한국 사람 여자들이, 그랬더시…나 또한 예기 낳니깐, 엄마가 미역국을 끄려 좋서…그걸로 몸 따뜻하게 해주고, 피를 맑에 해주고. 그래서, 미역국을 많이 먹었지. 딴때 봏다, 예기를 낳고. 그리고, 한국은 모 구지 자주 그냥 평일에 자주 많이 않 먹고, 꼭 생일에는 미역국을 끄려 먹드시…응.\r\nC: 근대, 왜 생일에 미역국을 먹어요? 그게 그렇게 특별한…\r\nI: 특별하기 보다도….그렇니깐 내가 예기 했잖아, 애기를 낳쓰니깐. 자기가 태여낫 잖아. \r\nC: 아…\r\nI: 내가 태여 났을때 엄마가 미역국을 드쎴듯이. 그래서 태여난 긋때는 생일 이라고 해서 미역국을 끄려 주는거지. 그런거 갓에. \r\nC: 그리고, 우리가요…모드라 지금 한국인이미국에서 살고 있잖아요…근대, 미역국을 개속 끄려 먹는 이유가 몬거 같아요? \r\nI: 그렇니깐, 나도 모…근대 그 유래가 어디서 부터 시작 되는지…엇던 사람은 미역국도 먹고, 중국 사람은 국수를 먹잖아…오래 사르라고 국수를 먹는대. 근대 더러 어떤 분들은, 미역국 대신은 국수를, 모 오래 사르라고 그렇는대. 내가 볼때는 왜 긋대 미역국 이였는지…내가 알기로는 엄마가 나를…근대 그때 보통들 보면 거희 미역국을 모 자주 먹는 그거는 아닌거 같았어, 옛날에는…미역국을 자주 먹는게 아니라…그래서 해산 할때 그럴까, 모 애기 낳는다고, 해산때…그래서 미역이 이렇게…파는거 보면, 일부로 상모영 미역이 따로 있어. 그만큼, 그 미역이 여자 한태는 괜장이 좋은 거야. 더군 다나, 우리가 애를 낳으면, 그만큼 몸이 많이 않좋은 상태 잖아. 근대 그 미역이라는 자채가 바다에 고기라고 예기를 하거등. \r\nC: 몸에, 건강에 좋아서요? 아…\r\nI: 건가에 되게 좋은 거지. 특히 여자들. 애를 낳았을때, 여자들 몸이 그렇게 않 좋진아. 그렇니깐 미역이 그만큼 우리 몸에…그렇니깐, 엣날에 부터 한국에 오래 전부터 서민들이 돈이 없어서, 고기 같은걸 많이…월래 고기 좀…모 고기국을 끄려서 먹어야 되는대. 돈들이 없잖아. 그랬을때 서민 쪽으로 좋은…그렇니깐, 싸면서도 좋은게 미역 이였단 말이야. 그래서 그렇게 인제가 된거 같에, 내 생각에는. 그래서 애기를 날때는 미역국으로 해서 먹어도 이게 몸이…왜냐 햐면, 여자들은 또 땀도 내야 돼고 뫃 해야 돼니깐, 뜨거운 국물에 미역국…미역 이라는 자채가 괜장히…그렇니깐, 그때는 고기를 않 너도 그 미역 자체 만으로도 영양이 풍부 했기때문애.   \r\nC: 그렇면, 그거를, 어…모드라, 우리가 지금 미국에서 사는돼도 개속 하는거는 몸에 좋고…그렇는…응.\r\nI: 그렇니깐. 응. 그렇지. \r\nC: 근대, 미역국 통해서요, 한국인 이라는 느낌은 받냐요? 말을잘, 통력을 잘 못해서… \r\nI: 미역을 먹으면서 내가 한국인 이라는 것을? \r\nC: 내. \r\nI: 근대 내 생각에는…중국 사람들은 애 낳고 모를 먹는지는 모르지만, 우리는…우리 한국 사람들은 미역 하며는 생일날 아니면 디부분, 엄마가 애를 났을때. 지금도 현대 적으로 병원 가서 애를 낫지만…병월 에서도 애기를 낳면은 미역국이 나와. 지금 현대 서도. 그렇니깐 그만큼 미역이 좋다는게 인정을 하는거지. 그만큼 바이타민이 엄청 풍부 하기때문에. \r\nC: 그리고여, 이새 한태…모 한나 던가 다나가 나중에 애를 낳으면요 미역국을 가리키고 싶어요? \r\nI: 그렇치 미역은 좋은 거니간. 내가 봤을 때는 그게 바다에 해산물도 다 좋지만…그래도 미역이 좋은 거니깐. \r\nC: 구지 한국에 미역국이 아니라, 몸에 좋은 음식 이라서요? \r\nI: 응. 그렇치. 특히 우리 몸에 좋은 거니깐. 그래서…마니들 서너 하는거지. \r\nC: 그리고, 사장님은여 미역국을 한국 대표를 해서요…한국에 대한 음식이 돼에서…1부터 10으로 얼마만큼 중요한…사장님 한태는 얼마만큼 중요한 랭킹을 하면요, 얼마나 포인트를 줄꺼 같아요?\r\nI: 미역이?\r\nC: 10 이 재일 많이 주는 거구요, 1이 재일 적게 주는 거에요. \r\nI: 아 그래? 그러면, 7 정도. \r\nC: 왜 7 랭킹을 주셨어요?\r\nI: 그게 여자 한태는, 그렇니깐…포인트가 다 좋은 음식들이 많잔아…그대 그 자연에서 나는 음식 중에서도 그개 바다에서는 재일 그래도 재일 좋은 음식이고…그리고, 모 남자들 한태도 좋치만, 여자들 한태는…특히 엄마들 한태는 미역 하면은 그개 몸에 좋타는걸…누구나 다 알고있으니깐, 그럼 면에서는 나는 7을 줬지.  \r\nC: 사장님 한태는 7이 큰 숫자에요?\r\nI: 응. \r\nC: 네 됐어요. 다른거 혹씨 나누고 싶으거 없어요? 없어요?\r\nI: 응.

We sat right next to each other at a table that was placed against the wall, which was closest to the door. The interview was held in the evening (approximately around 6 PM). There were two other family members in the apartment. They were watching Korean drama out in the living room. TV sounds traveled into the room and were somewhat distracting; however, the interview was still manageable. Elijah was doing homework on his computer before the interview took place, so he was a bit disoriented. The mood was slightly hectic. \r\n\r\nC: Ok, my first question is what is 미역국? Can you explain to me what미역국 is?\r\nI: I guess it is a Korean seaweed soup, I think…a kind of tradition. When you have a birthday then you make…your parents make it for you and you eat it. That’s basically a Korean tradition. \r\nC: Ok, so do you know what kind of special occasions do you drink…no, not drink but eat 미역국 other than birthdays?\r\nI: Uh, there is no really special occasion except birthdays mostly. But I think that is the only… \r\nC: Do you know how to make 미역국?\r\nI: No, but I think it’s easy because all you need is seaweed, water, a bit of salt, and I think garlic that my mom puts in a little. And I think that’s it.  \r\nC: Ok, can you try and explain the process to me or you don’t know that far? Do you just know what goes in it?\r\nI: I guess you put water, then you put in the seaweed, and then you put maybe the salt and then garlic or garlic and then the salt…and I guess you just boil it for however long. And that’s all I know. \r\nC: Ok, good. Do you want to learn how to make 미역국 one day?\r\nI: Yea, since if I do grow up and marry. Probably I can make it for my wife or my family. \r\nC: And do you plan on learning it from your mom?\r\nI: Yea.\r\nC: Well, what about your sister? Do you want to learn it from your sisters?\r\n	I: I don’t think they know how to make it. But if they do know…then I probably might.  \r\nC: And um…how many different versions of 미역국have you tried, other than your mom’s? \r\nI: Like multiples…3-4 maybe because my mom’s friends, this one grandma’s…\r\nC: Do you know how they make their 미역국? Do you remember what else they put in there?\r\nI: Yea, beef…they put in beef. Meat, kind of…a little chunk of meat in the…yea. That is it\r\nC: Ok, in the past…I can’t really ask you this…well, in the past…who made you 미역국? Did your friend make you 미역국 or only your mom so far? \r\nI: I think my mom so far. And I think I remember my dad making it once but it was pretty bitter.  \r\nC: I see. (Laughs) Do you have any…when you are growing up…have any special memories of 미역국 like on your birthdays or somebody actually making it…?\r\nI: No, not really. It is because I only knew that you eat, you know, 미역국 on your birthdays so…I didn’t recognize that until I got older. That’s it. \r\nC: Ok and how any times have you had -? Just estimate. \r\nI: About like…\r\nC: For sure, or…\r\n	I: Around since I am only in high school, probably around at least 10. \r\nC: At least 10 times?  \r\nI: Because you know, when I was five years old, I don’t think I ate 미역국before. \r\nC: Oh…ok. And why is 미역국…or is it meaningful to you? Why is it so important? What makes it so important?\r\nI: It’s important because it is a Korean tradition. And I mean without it, on your birthday, what else would you eat? Since in Korea, or Koreans, we eat that certain soup instead of something else. You know? \r\nC: And why do you think it’s that? Why do you think it has to be 미역국 not 김치찌게 or 됀장찌게? \r\nI: I don’t know. Maybe it is just seaweed that…seaweed has that kind of flowing and smooth…I don’t know that one texture…I mean, if you see it on birthdays…you don’t want to eat anything spicy or...I mean, you can. But as a Korean you already have a thing called 김치 as well.  \r\nC: So it’s kind of a set thing?\r\nI: Yea, it is a set thing. And, I mean, it is also from the ancestors that is passed on. You don’t want to change. \r\nC:  Ok, you know how we are like a 2nd …or 1st generation or 2nd generation Korean immigrants here…why do you think believe or why do you think your family continues to make 미역국? Why do you think it’s so special other than the fact that it’s something that you believe Koreans do?\r\nI: Because their parents also made it as well. And for us…I mean they want us to practice that as well I think and pass it on to our children and on and on. \r\n C: Do you feel closer to being Korean when you have미역국 during your birthday?\r\nI: Yea. \r\nC: Is it something that you resemble with your Korean heritage? \r\n	I: Yea.  \r\nC: Ok, would you…if you learn how to make미역국would you pass it on to your children too?\r\nI: Yea. \r\nC: And then their children?\r\nI: Yea from now on. \r\nC:  Why would you think that? \r\nI: I want to continue, you know, what has been passed down. And you don’t want to break a chain. So…I guess you pass it down\r\n C: Ok, and If you were to rank from 1to 10, how important is 미역국 compared to other Korean…like a미역국 for a Korean dish? 10 being the good like most and … \r\nI: 8? 8… \r\nC: Why would you say 8? \r\nI: Because 8 I think is the right number. It can’t be 5, half and half. 8, since, I think the most important probably is 김치 and you can’t eat without that as Asians. But 미역국 is probably an 8 so…cause you know, most of the Koreans eat 미역국 on their birthdays or their parents birthdays or other cousins or family’s birthdays…but it’s better for the same age. \r\nC: Ok, is there anything else you want to say about 미역국 ?\r\nI: No, I just like 미역국. I just like to eat the seaweed. It is smooth and it has a good taste in your mouth. That’s why I like it. \r\nC: Ok, thank you. \r\n\r\n\r\n','Elijah3 - Transcription.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',21492,1695806),(134,19,-1,125,'Korean Seaweed Soup 4A','Fieldnotes','KOREAN 183: KOREAN FOLKLORE\r\nField-Assignment \r\nSeaweed Soup – Culinary Practices  \r\n\r\nCollector: Sin Hye (Cindy) Lee\r\nInterviewee: Vivian Lee\r\nRelationship: Sister\r\nDate Recorded: 2/26/2012 (Sunday)\r\nRecorded Length – 11 Minutes 40 Seconds \r\n\r\nContext: Interview session was held in my room at our family apartment during the evening (approximately around 8 PM). My mother was outside in the living room but we could not hear her from our location. Interviewee looked tired because she just came back home from school and work. The mood was quiet and relaxing and there were no any distractions. The environment was pleasant. \r\n\r\nC: Ok, so what is 미역국? \r\nI: 미역국 is seaweed, basically, and you add water or seafood if you want to…and you eat it on your birthday. \r\nC: And in what other special occasions do you prepare or make미역국…only on birthdays or any other days?\r\nI: It’s mostly birthdays but in my case, I like to eat it a lot, so I make it maybe once a month. \r\nC: How do you make your미역국?\r\nI: First, I get the dried 미역and then I wash it with cold water, so it gets watery and gooey. And then I put it on the pan and cook it with…oil. Then, if I want to add some meat in there, I put meat and I cook it without water at first. When everything is all cooked and marinated together by adding salt, I add water and then I add onions. \r\nC: Um, are there other methods that you know of making 미역국?  \r\nI: There are a lot of different methods.  \r\nC: Can you tell me some?\r\nI: The first, well the method I like is putting a lot of oil, sesame oil. Well, some people use sesame oil and some people use just regular oil. I like to use regular oil because that is the oil that isn’t too flavory and it gets the seaweed flavor out of the soup. It depends on your preferences, but…and some people like beef or they like seafood. \r\nC: What kind of seafood would you put in it?\r\n	I: Oysters. \r\nC: And how did you learn how to make 미역국?\r\nI: I learned it through my mother. \r\nC: Ok, and how old were you when you first learned how to make 미역국? \r\nI: Um, when I was like 15? \r\nC: And in the past, who generally made – for you?\r\nI: My mommy. \r\nC: I see. What about…is there anybody else?\r\nI: Nope. \r\nC: And how do they make it…like how does your mom make it differently than the way you make it… 미역국? Is it any different between the way she makes it and you make it? \r\nI: No, because I basically learned it from her so…the ingredients are the same. But, you know what they say…mom and daughter; you can’t compare the two since moms are always the best! But, it is just the ingredients.\r\nC: Ok, so do you think they taste different?\r\nI: Well, I think my mom’s taste a little better because she cooked 미역국 for a long time and I just started so…but, I think mine is good too.  \r\nC: Do you have any special memories of 미역국when you were growing up? Anything you can think of?\r\nI: Um….Well, when it was my birthday…I mean, it was my birthday but I totally forgot that it was my birthday and when I woke up my mom already made 미역국 for me in the morning. And then that’s when I realized that it was my birthday so…Yeah, and it was really good and she made a whole lot so I ate it for like a week. And it reminded me of my birthday, which I didn’t even know of. \r\nC: Any other times?\r\nI: Well, we were just like gathered together with family and eat 미역국and it is like our culture so…you know, it brings back old memories. Most of the time… \r\nC: Have you made it for others before? \r\nI: Yea, I made it for my boyfriend once and my mom once for her birthday. Basically, I made it for birthdays most of the time. \r\nC: why do you think we don’t eat 미역국 in any other special occasions? Like something like birthdays or instead of it…\r\nI: Because it makes us feel special in a way. And it makes us…our food makes us show that, you know, how we appreciate each other. And 미역국 is really healthy so it’s really good to eat a lot of it anyways. So basically if you eat it on your birthday then it’s more of a better thing. \r\nC:  How many times do you think you ate 미역국 in your life…at minimum amount? \r\nI: Minimum? One million times. \r\n C: Um, really? I don’t think it’s one million. Are you sure…being realisitically?\r\nI: Yea. \r\nC: Minimum. \r\n	I: Umm…maybe like 50,000?  \r\nC: Ok, 50,000.\r\nI: I really like to enjoy…I just like to enjoy it on regular meals. So I make it on my own, most of the time. \r\nC: How many times do you plan on eating 미역국?\r\nI: Oh my gosh! (Laughs) Are you asking me this question? Of course, I would eat it like every single month, or every single week at least. \r\nC:  So what does 미역국 mean to you? What does this dish mean to you? What does it symbolize? \r\nI: It symbolizes Korean culture, respect, health, and love. \r\n C: So what about respect?  \r\nI: You are kind of respecting someone if you are cooking it for them because you want them to be healthy and you respect your health. \r\nC: As a Korean America, 1st or 2nd generation, why do you think you continue to cook seaweed soup as a Korean tradition or a Korean dish? Why do you think you cook it?\r\nI: Because I don’t want to lose the Korean tradition, you know, in the family even though I am a Korean American and born here. I still want to keep it in me because I am still Korean. My blood is still Korean. And it is really good. It’s healthy and it’s good and simple. \r\nC: How is it healthy? \r\nI: Because seaweed is good for you and it is not that we use a lot of MSG in it. It’s just water, plain water, seaweed, and if you want beef or seafood (seafood is good for you too), and onions…so that’s makes it really good…the soup. It is not like they put a lot of MSG in it. \r\nC: Do you plan on teaching it to future generations?\r\nI: Of course, I would definitely teach it to you, to my children, to my husband, and anyone…my friends. \r\nC: Even friends that are not Korean? \r\n	I: Yea…they would enjoy it because it’s good. \r\nC: For the taste or? \r\nI: For the taste…duh…\r\nC: Ok, do you feel closer to your Korean heritage by making미역국? \r\nI: Yea, because I am sharing what they had before and what they are having in Korea. So I feel like we are one since we are eating the same kind of food. \r\nC:  Do you feel that you eat or cook미역국differently than the method used in Korea or do you think it is very similar?\r\nI: It is very similar because my mom cooks it the way my grandma made it. And my grandma made it the way my great grandma made it. So…it is pretty much the same thing. And it is not even that complicating to me. \r\n C: Why do you think it didn’t change much? Why do you think people didn’t change, add certain things that were acceptable for미역국?\r\nI: I guess, because the taste was good enough. If you start adding a lot of ingredients on there, it’s going to totally ruin the flavor. \r\nC: what kind of ingredients would ruin the flavor?\r\nI: Like anything else that we put in today like MSG and fake ingredients. And like too much salt. We don’t even add a lot of salt. A lot of people add a lot of salt and MSG, which is really bad. I think that the reason why we don’t change the soup is because…it’s just perfect the way it is right now. There is no reason to change it because it is that…delicious. And it is our culture so we don’t want to change the culture for our food.   \r\nC: So if you add to much salt or MSG, you think that’s not미역국anymore?\r\nI: No, because미역국is from the seaweed – the flavor of the seaweed. If you add too much ingredients…that would just ruin the whole taste of the seaweed.  \r\nC: So for you, - is the taste of the seaweed?\r\nI: Yea, seaweed and a little tiny bit of oil, sesame oil. \r\nC: So from 1 through 10, how important would you rank – as a Korean culinary dish?\r\nI: Definitely 10. \r\nC: Why 10?\r\nI: Because first, like I said, it is healthy and it is not hard to make. It takes like less than 20 minutes to cook it. All you need is water, seafood, and salt or beef. And ... I think - represents our culture very well because it has been passed down for many generations. And it’s healthy. \r\nC:  Would you like to add any additional information or comments about미역국? Anything you want to say?\r\nI: I just want to say… I just want to emphasize that it is really healthy. So, you know, you can eat it when you’re sick, and you’ll get better. Your digestive system will be better. Your skin will be better. Seafood is really healthy. So, I would, you know, make it for a lot of different reasons too. And it’s not…the taste, flavor is not too rough. It is very smooth and it is not like too much flavor or anything. It is a hot soup so anyone can drink it or eat it. And…yea.  \r\nC: That’s it? \r\n	I: That’s it.   \r\n\r\n','Vivian4 - Transcription.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',22463,1695860),(135,19,-1,126,'Korean Seaweed Soup 5A','Fieldnotes','KOREAN 183: KOREAN FOLKLORE\r\nField-Assignment \r\nSeaweed Soup – Culinary Practices  \r\n\r\nCollector: Sin Hye (Cindy) Lee\r\nInterviewee: David, Yon Wook, Chung\r\nRelationship: Friend\r\nDate Recorded: 2/26/2012 (Sunday)\r\nRecorded Length – 8 Minutes 7 Seconds \r\n\r\nContext: Interview session was held in my room at our family apartment during the evening (approximately around 10 PM). My mother was outside in the living room but we could not hear her from our location. Interviewee looked tired because he came over to my house after work. The mood was the same, quiet and relaxing. My sister, Vivian, was also into the room during the interview but she was on her computer, doing her own thing. There were no other distractions. The environment was pleasant. \r\n\r\nC: Ok, Yon Wook, my first question is what is seaweed soup or미역국? Can you explain to me?\r\nI: 미역국 is a traditional food in Korea and we use to serve it…Korean serve it if it is their birthday or some special holiday. I don’t really know which holiday it is. But I know for sure it is on birthdays that you get seaweed soup. \r\nC: Ok, um, how do you make 미역국? Do you cook 미역국? \r\nI: No, I don’t.  \r\nC: Do you know how to make it?\r\nI: I could guess. I know, um, my grandmother used to make it with water. I know there is seaweed inside and she puts oysters. She puts this soy sauce that you only put it for certain traditional Korean soup. And she has to cook it for over at least a day. The seaweed gets really soft and the soup is very flavorful. \r\nC: When do you want to learn how to make 미역국?\r\nI: When I feel like…when I feel like there is no one else that can cook 미역국 for someone I care. If it is Korean…then I’ll…\r\nC: Who would you most likely want to learn 미역국from?\r\nI: My grandma. \r\nC: How many different version of the soup do you want to learn how to make?\r\n	I: Just one. \r\nC: How many…uh, in the past, who generally made 미역국 for you?\r\nI: Uh, my mom or my grandma. \r\nC: Can you explain to me how your grandma…Oh, you already did…how your mom made it and if it is different from your grandma made it?\r\nI: It is almost similar. But sometimes, she used to serve it without really boiling it for over a day and the soup doesn’t taste s flavorful. \r\nC: So does she (mother) also use oysters?\r\nI: Yes, she does use it. \r\nC: She doesn’t have any other variations?\r\nI: Not that I remember. She sometimes adds onions, um, and sometimes beef. \r\nC: Ok, and do you have any memories about 미역국 when you were growing up? For any special occasions or any 추억?\r\nI: Not any 추억 but I always remember 미역국 as part of the birthday. So even if someone forgets about birthday, if I see someone cooking 미역국, then I know someone around them, Korean, have a birthday. That’s about it...no real… \r\nC: How many times have you had 미역국 in your life?\r\nI: More than 23 times…at least\r\nC: For sure?\r\nI: For sure. But, um, that’s all I can guess. \r\nC: What about, how many times do you plan on eating 미역국in the future?\r\nI: Every…at least once a year, I hope…and if I get a lot of Korean friends…maybe if I get 3 or 4 more friends. \r\nC: Why not…does it have to be Korean friends who make it for you? Why do you say Korean friends?\r\nI: Actually, I would love for another ethnicity to learn our culture. But I am pretty sure that they already have theirs. Um, and I don’t know, it just feel more at home. \r\nC: Why is 미역국 special or meaningful to you?\r\nI: Um…\r\nC:  What does it symbolize to you? \r\nI: Symbolize? I don’t know…it’s just that it’s connected to birthdays. So, whenever it’s someone birthday everybody is supposed to be happy. So I guess that’s why it kind of makes me happy when I eat 미역국.\r\n C: Ok, and as a Korean American here, why do you think you continue to make or eat seaweed soup 미역국  in America? Why do you think we still do that here? Why do you think you do that here?\r\nI: Well, I think first of all…everybody does what American people do…so, they stick with their tradition. And I just feel more comfortable with eating it. It just feels like a birthday. Without it, a birthday isn’t complete. It has become a tradition of mine, also yea…\r\nC: And, when do you plan on making – for other people…other than their birthday, only their birthday, or any other time?\r\nI: Actually, I am kind of familiarized with American food. So I don’t really mind eating just American food. So probably I won’t be cooking for anybody unless it’s their birthday.\r\nC: Would you cook for somebody that is Korean? Or…wait, would you cook 미역국only for somebody is a Korean friend or for someone who is not Korean? \r\nI: I would cook for someone who is not Korean but that person has to be pretty close to me.\r\nC: Oh, ok. And do you think that by making 미역국 you feel closer to your Korean heritage? \r\nI: Yes, I think so. \r\nC:  In what way?\r\nI: It might seem like nothing but we still think about -. When we think about -, we also think about our parents and how they treat us. I think that kind of passes down, like the characteristics, from our parents to the children. \r\nC: Do you feel that the way we make 미역국or the way you make 미역국 here…or the way you see your grandma or mom make 미역국…Do you think it is different from the way they make it in South Korea right now?\r\nI: I am pretty sure that every family has their special way of making 미역국, like your family, so yes.  \r\nC: Do you think that they are really different from South Korean and America?\r\nI: Actually, not really because I am pretty sure that every South Korean family is different. 미역국came from South America. So…unless we are using different ingredients, I think, they should all generally be the same. \r\nC: 미역국came from South America?\r\nI: No, in South Korea. Did I say South America? (Laughs)  \r\nC:  Yea, I was confused for a little bit…I was like, I never heard that before. But, so if you were to rate 미역국 from 1 from the least important to 10 being the most important in Korean culinary culture, where would you rank it…with all other types of food?\r\nI: I say...10! \r\n C: 10? Why 10?\r\nI: Well, I think that birthday is really important, first of all. And, um, it is just one of the dishes that never get left out in Korean culture. \r\nC: What other dish can you think of…that are as important as 미역국 in Korean culture?\r\nI: 잡체. 잡체come out in a lot of celebrated occasions.\r\nC: So you would also make that a 10? \r\nI: No, I don’t like잡체. I hate잡체. \r\nC: So it would be?\r\nI: A 0. \r\nC: I see. So what are some, um, what are any information or comments you want to make about미역국? Anything else you want to tell me or comes to your mind about미역국? \r\nI: No, I think that my grandma’s미역국is the best.  \r\nC: Ok, anything else? \r\nI: That’s it.	 \r\nC: Thank you. \r\nI: Sure, no problem. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n','Yon Wook5 - Transcription.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',21610,1695896),(136,19,-1,127,'Korean Seaweed Soup 6A','Fieldnotes','KOREAN 183: KOREAN FOLKLORE\r\nField-Assignment \r\nSeaweed Soup – Culinary Practices  \r\n\r\nCollector: Sin Hye (Cindy) Lee\r\nInterviewee: Eui Soon Lee\r\nRelationship: Mother \r\nDate Recorded: 2/26/2012 (Sunday)\r\nRecorded Length – 12 Minutes 53 Seconds \r\n\r\nContext: Interview session was held in my room at our family apartment during the evening (approximately around 11 PM). My sister was in the room but stayed quiet and was doing her homework while the interview was in session. Interviewee looked tired because it was getting later into the night. The mood was quiet and relaxing and there were no any distractions. The environment was pleasant.\r\n\r\nC: Mom, my first question is…what is Seaweed soup?\r\nI: Korea’s Seaweed soup is a special drink that you eat on your birthday.\r\nC: What goes in the Seaweed soup?\r\nI: It is made by various foods that come from the ocean. You can put in 미역 or 홍압. You can make a variety of 미역국. But usually, on birthdays, you put in beef in the soup. \r\nC: Do you only eat it on your birthday or are there any other days that you can eat it?\r\nI: You can enjoy it at other times but especially during birthdays, most people eat미역국. \r\nC: Why do you think that you eat미역국 on birthdays?\r\nI: Korean people tend to…when you have a kid you continue to eat미역국, from the first week to a month after giving birth. Seaweed soup is good for the mother who need to breastfeed. It is good for the mother and the baby. You know…women can get bloated.  It is the best food to eat when you are also taking care of your body after giving birth. And…it’s about mom. Mostly we eat it during our birthday but…Korean women who have a kid must eat미역국for a minimum of a month. Your body can heal faster…it’s a distinctive Korean way…It’s also good for the baby.\r\nC: How do you make your미역국?\r\nI: I take the dried Seaweed and dunk it in water. After rinsing it and taking all the water out, I slice it into pieces that are good for eating. After slicing the seaweed, I mix in meat, sesame oil, and stir them together. After cooking these three ingredients, I add in water. When you boil the soup for some time, the nutrients from the seaweed comes out. Then you add salt and garlic to the soup. It is a representation of Korean food. \r\nC: Mom, who did you learn how to make미역국from?\r\nI: From your grandma. \r\nC: How old were you when you first learned how to make미역국? \r\nI: When I first learned it? When I was 18 years old…\r\nC: Then, how many methods do you make your -?\r\nI: The way I make it…I put in onions and sometimes I put in white rice. I usually don’t put it in because I am not sure if you guys would like it or not. You can put white rice in the shape of a bird’s egg. You can also put in 홍압 or 해산물 in the soup. There are about five different ways that I make it. \r\nC: Can you explain each one?\r\nI: To explain each one…So basically, all five are about the same. The first, you can put in meat. Second, instead of meat you can put in white rice in round shapes. The way you make – is almost about the same. For홍압, you have to get the frozen one. You dump it into the water to wash it out. You may include sesame oil, but most people might not use this for 홓압.Then you can also add a little 해물 다시다.   \r\nC: Isn’t다시다 an MSG?\r\nI: No, it’s not MSG. It’s just another ingredient. When you put in 해물, you put in some 해물 다시마. When you put in beef, you put in 소고기 다시마. The scent is more unique. When you put in white rice, I’m guessing that you generally add in sesame oil.\r\nC: Then when you were little, who usually made – for you?\r\nI: For me, my mother. Whenever our family had a birthday, my mother would always…during my father’s and brother’s birthday, my mom would always make 미역국 for us. \r\nC: Why do you think your dad did not make it for you?\r\nI: Because Korean men do not like going into the kitchen. Based on past ideology, men were not supposed to cook. \r\nC: Then do you think that your method of making 미역국 is different or same from the way your mom made it?\r\nI: It’s similar from the way I made it and your grandma made it. \r\nC: And…how did grandma make it? Is it basically the same?\r\nI: Yes….Since I learned it from your grandma.\r\nC: How many different version of the 미역국 have you tried?\r\nI: About 4 types? It depends on the district. In North Korea, they put in the white rice. \r\nC: When you were little, do you have any good or special memories of미역국-? When you think of 미역국?\r\nI: When you eat 미역국, family will come together to celebrate one’s birthday. They would give simple presents to one another.  \r\nC: How many times do you think you ate 미역국 in your life?\r\nI: Since we make 미역국 at least one time a month…at minimum, twelve times right? Since there are 12 months in a year…at least 12 times. We eat it a lot. On basic level, Korean people eat 기치찌게, 됀장찌게, 무국, 콩나물국, and기치 콩나물국. Korean people must always have some type of soup. There are various types of soups. 미역국 is a special soup that we also eat on our birthdays. It’s good because it’s good for your health and skin.\r\nC: Why do you feel that 미역국 is special to you?\r\nI: Because I ate it since I was a child. I am used to the food and because I know that the soup is good for your body. \r\nC: In what ways is seaweed good for you?\r\nI: First it helps with constipation/digesting. Second for the skin... \r\nC: Also we are Korean Americans who are living in the United States. Why do you think that we continue to make and eat food here in the states?\r\nI: Because it’s our traditional Korean food that has been passed down since the past. Korean people made 미역국 whenever it was someone’s birthday.  \r\nC: Would you be willing to teach future generations such as my kids how to make 미역국?\r\nI: Of course. \r\nC: Even though they are not Korean?\r\nI: Even though they are not Korean, most people would like it. \r\nC: Why would they like it?\r\nI: Because the soup is delicious and it is not spicy.\r\nC: What is one reason why you make 미역국?\r\nI: Because 미역국 is special.\r\nC: Do you think that when we make 미역국 in America we feel closer to our Korean heritage?\r\nI: Only Korean people make 미역국. Japanese people also make a similar version called the miso soup. They also put in a little bit of seaweed….the type of soup that comes out in sushi soup. They are similar. \r\nC: Why do you think that 미역국 has not changed much while they may be slightly different?\r\nI: Because seaweed is the main ingredient…since it is a soup that is mostly made of seaweed. You can add or take away a few things. \r\nC: What if we add hot sauce or spicy sauce in it?\r\nI: Then 미역국 would not taste not 미역국. 미역국 will taste strange.\r\nC: Then that’s not 미역국 to you?\r\nI: Of course. \r\nC: And…you know the 미역국 that we make in U.S. Do you think that it is the same as the way people make 미역국 in Korea?  \r\nI: Yes. \r\nC: If you were to rank 미역국 from 1 (the least) to 10 (the most important)…from the Korean dishes, how would you rank it?\r\nI: About 3?\r\nC: No, the number 10 is the most. \r\nI: Then, 8. \r\nC: Why 8?\r\nI: Because may people like it. And since any Korean person or Korean family eat미역국during their birthday. A greeting that most Korean people ask is if the person had미역국on their birthday or not. \r\nC: Why is it not 10?\r\nI: Since there are other Korean dishes that are more important such as 떡국 that you eat during New Years. There are various types of foods in Korea. Soups that most Korean people eat often is 김치찌게 and 됀장찌게.  Then next it would be미역국. Then it would be a fish soup that is refreshing. But if I have to choose for미역국, then it would be 8. \r\nC: Is there any other information that you would like to say about미역국?\r\nI: Nothing else, just that it’s good for your body. \r\nC: why is it good for your body?\r\nI: It’s good for digestion and congestion. If you continue eating미역국, then you will see how you use the restroom more easily, especially if you eat all the main part (seaweed) of the soup. The better you use the restroom; it shows that you have better circulation. When you have a kid, there are regions in the body where it gets widened /stretched. When you eat미역국, then it helps for the body to return to how it was. You use the restroom. When you have your kid, people ask if you farted first at the hospital. That is how much your digestive system is not in the right position. Even if you do not fart, you can leave the hospital but if you continue eating미역국then you can eventually fart. \r\nC: Ok, any more information?\r\nI: No. That’s all. \r\nC: Thank you mom. \r\nI: Just…\r\nC: Just what?\r\nI: Just that it’s good for your body. \r\n\r\n','Mom6 - Transcription.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',23002,1695930),(137,19,-1,128,'Korean Seaweed Soup 7A','Fieldnotes','KOREAN 183: KOREAN FOLKLORE\r\nField-Assignment \r\nSeaweed Soup – Culinary Practices  \r\n\r\nCollector: Sin Hye (Cindy) Lee\r\nInterviewee: Mimi Requa \r\nRelationship: Family Friend (Aunt 이모) \r\nDate Recorded: 3/7/2012 (Wednesday)\r\nRecorded Length – 11 Minutes 58 Seconds \r\n\r\nContext: Interview session was held in the basement of interviewee’s house in the evening (approximately around 8 PM).There were several other people in the house – her husband, 4 year old son, and several friends. The house was filled with hustling activity but most of the noise was kept inside the 1st floor living room. We retreated to the basement for greater privacy. There were several interruptions during the interview session. First, her 4 year old son (Rome) decided to take a shower in the basement restroom. My mother helped give him a shower, but Mimi still seemed less focused because she was concerned about her son. Second, her husband yelled from the first floor to ask interviewee if she was taking care of their son. The mood was hectic. Overall, the environment was vibrant yet distracting. \r\n\r\nC: I’m going to ask you some questions about미역국.First, what is미역국? \r\nI: 미역국is usually a food that you eat when you have a child or on your birthday.\r\nC: What’s in미역국? \r\nI: The Ocean’s grass. We take that and eat it. \r\nC: And after giving birth or on your birthday, when are other times you eat it?\r\nI: When you are on a diet. You can put in chicken. Some people eat it like that when they are on a diet. Or you can eat미역국if your body is bloated or when you have poor body circulation. \r\nC: Aunt, how do you make your미역국?\r\nI: I take beef and seaweed. I put seaweed in the water, take it out, and then cook it with the beef. When you cook it, the color of the seaweed turns very pretty – a bluish color. So afterward, you just add water. The soup is done when the water boils.  \r\nC: And…who did you learn how to make미역국?\r\nI: 미역국?...From my grandma. \r\nC: How old were you when you first learned how to make미역국?\r\nI: When I was 8 or 9.\r\nC: That early?\r\nI: In the past…at the countryside, you learned how to cook when you are young to help your parents (mom and dad). \r\n	Distraction  ROME “Mom, I want to shower.”\r\nC: Ok, go shower with Auntie (My Mother). \r\nI: Go shower with Auntie. \r\nC: Usually there is only one method you make미역국, but are there times when you add different ingredients?\r\nI: I dunk the seaweed in water and then take it out. I slightly mix it with cut cucumbers. I make 뭇침 with it. It tastes really good this way.     \r\nC: Who generally made – for you?\r\nI: My grandma.\r\nC: What about your mom?\r\nI: She made it when my mom made children or birthdays. \r\nC: Do you think that the method you make미역국is the same as the way your grandma made it?\r\nI: Yes, it’s exactly the same since I learned how to make it from her. \r\nC: Do you have any special memories when you think about미역국?\r\nI:  When I had a child and on birthdays when I was young? When I had a child…my mother-in-law is an American so she does not know anything about미역국. So one of my friends cooked미역국for me. My mother-in-law placed the soup in the heater (warming pad) for a week without putting it in the refrigerator. She gave me that slightly molding soup but I was not aware of it until afterwards. I was really sad. \r\nC: When you ate the moldy soup, did you know it was in that condition?\r\nI: No, I did not know but the soup tasted and smelled a little sour. I had a surgery so I could not walk downstairs. When I came down slowly after a couple days, I saw that the미역국was placed under a warmer and it was slightly moldy. \r\nC: You’re not supposed to do that right?\r\nI: No, you’re not. So…I didn’t even get to eat미역국. I only ate small pieces of potato and lettuce. When you have to feed your baby, you need a lot of milk. You are supposed to eat a lot of미역국 if you want to produce a lot of milk.  \r\nC: Why do you have to eat a lot of미역국?\r\nI: If you do that, you produce more milk. And it is also good for your body circulation. \r\nC: And why do you think that you were sad at that time? To you미역국is important…	\r\nI: Because my American mother-in-law is not giving me any미역국. She just gives me a piece of potato and lettuce. That’s all she gave me. She did not give me much water either. You have to drink a lot of water to produce more milk. (Laughs) So I was kind of sad during this time.  \r\nC: How many times do you think you ate미역국?\r\nI:  So many times that I can’t count it. \r\nC:  My questions can be kind of funny huh? And what meaning does미역국carry for you?\r\nI: Long ago, my grandma told me a story that there was a guy who went to the ocean and saw a whale that gave birth eating seaweed. So he thought that it must be good for the mother. Back in the village, people use to give seaweed as present for mothers who just gave birth, to heal the body faster. Ever since then, we began eating미역국. Why we eat미역국in birthdays is because we never forget our mothers. \r\nC: It’s about our mother’s memories?\r\nI: Today is the day that my mother gave birth to me so you also eat미역국. \r\n	Distraction  Interviewee’s husband “Mimi, do you have Rome?”\r\nC: And right now, we are Korean immigrants living in America. Why do you think that we continue to eat and make미역국 when we are far away from Korea?\r\nI: Because we are used to the taste. People who like the taste of미역국, they make it more. Also people eat it more because it’s good for your body. \r\nC: Do you feel that when we eat미역국we feel closer to our Korean heritage?\r\nI: Yes, that too. \r\nC: Since other people do not make미역국. \r\nI: Others don’t eat미역국. They ask how we can eat seaweed. Even during birthdays, I asked my father-in-law if he wanted some미역국, but they were not too enthusiastic about it because they are American. He said no thank you. We think it tastes good but they don’t really like it.  \r\nC: But, does your husband like미역국?\r\nI: Yes, he really likes it and eats it well. \r\nC: Does he generally like Korean food?\r\nI: Yes.\r\nC: Do you think that the way we make미역국is the same as people make it in Korea?\r\nI: I think it’s the same basically. \r\nC: Why do you think that it didn’t change much?  \r\nI: Because by making it, we do not forget about the way it is made in Korea. We think about Korea…so the taste is the same. \r\nC: Why do you think that we do not put in hot sauce in미역국?\r\nI: Because I think that would make미역국taste a bit weird. \r\nC: Because it is hot sauce? What if we put in different things?\r\nI: No, it is still미역국. In Jeju islands, they put in a big, whole 갈치fish in the soup. Jeju people make it a way that other Koreans do not. It’s strange. But people on the peninsula cannot eat that because it tastes strange. \r\nC: The taste is weird?\r\nI: It doesn’t taste good. \r\nC: You’ve tried it before?\r\nI: Yes.\r\nC: What other ingredients can you put in that is ok?\r\nI: Anchovies, beef, clam, potato, bird eggs, and…\r\nC: But no hot sauce?\r\nI: No! (Laughs) Should we try making it with hot sauce?\r\nC: No (Laughs)\r\nI: But there are some people who puts in 고추까루. Yes, the dried, ground spicy pepper. Some people who like to eat spicy food. \r\nC: If you would rank 미역국 as a Korean food from 1(least) to 10 (most important), what would you give it?\r\nI: About 10.\r\nC: Why do you think it is 10?\r\nI: Because it’s one thing we don’t forget. When a mother gives birth…it’s one of the greatest events in life. So thinking of this time…and you also eat it on your birthday. You must eat 미역국 on your birthday even if it is at night. It is essential. \r\nC: Combined with other foods like 김치…that’s the final number?\r\nI: Yes.\r\nC: Do you have any other information you would like to share about 미역국?\r\nI: No. \r\nC: Thank you, Auntie. \r\n\r\n','Mimi Requa7- transcription.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',22434,1695991),(138,19,172,129,'Korean Seaweed Soup 8A','Fieldnotes','KOREAN 183: KOREAN FOLKLORE\r\nField-Assignment \r\nSeaweed Soup – Culinary Practices  \r\n\r\nCollector: Sin Hye (Cindy) Lee\r\nInterviewee: Sun Hee Kim \r\nRelationship: Family Grandma \r\nDate Recorded: 3/12/2012 (Monday)\r\nRecorded Length – 10 Minutes 54 Seconds \r\n\r\nContext: Interview session was held in the living room of the interviewee’s apartment during the evening (approximately around 8 PM).There was no one else in the apartment.

After giving birth, there are a lot of bad leftovers in your body. 미역국helps get rid of all those excess things. \r\nC: Oh…and on your birthday and after birth…are there are times…?\r\nI: Korean people enjoy미역국on other times too because the seaweed that comes from the ocean is really good for your body. \r\nC: And…\r\nI: And…mothers eat미역국to get rid of all the blood and excess fat or guts that is in the body after giving birth. \r\nC: How do you make your -?\r\nI: You dunk the seaweed in water to dilute it. Then you wash it, drain the water, put it in a pot, and cook it with sesame oil. After a while you add in water or fish/seafood for people who like them. There are some people who put in meat. But the way that I liked the best was with 갈비. That tastes the best. For fish/seaweed type, it is best with clams.   \r\nC: How did you learn how to make -?\r\nI: I learned it from adults in the past. Other dishes that you can also make are 미역 뭇침 and 미역 낸국. 미역낸국은…you wash the seaweed clean…then you add water and vinegar. It is a dish that you eat in the summer. \r\nC: Like cold?\r\nI: Yes. \r\nC: When was the first time you ate미역국?\r\nI: Our family used to make미역국in the past so I knew about it. But the age when I made the soup myself was after I came to America. I only ate the soup that others made for me when I was in Korea. \r\nC: How old do you think you were when you made it in America?\r\nI: When I made it myself…I came to American in 1974…so I made it for the first time in 1975 or 1976. \r\nC: Wow…yes. \r\nI: Before then, I did not know how to make it because I ate what others cooked for me. I had to make it myself in America so I learned it from a cook book. \r\nC: Who generally made미역국for you?\r\nI: When I was living in Korea, the people who worked in the home made it. Before then, I ate the ones that parents made for me. \r\nC: Was it mostly your mother? Not father?\r\nI: Korean people…Korean men never make food. \r\nC: Do you feel that the ways your mom made it and you make it are different?\r\nI: Yes, it is different. Long ago, when I was a child…the미역국that my mom made for me was the best.\r\nC: Why was it the best tasting?\r\nI: I am also not sure. It was made in the traditional Korean way. \r\nC: How many times do you think you had미역국in your lifetime?\r\nI: How do you estimate that? I ate it so much, you cannot count it. Whenever I do not crave anything, I often  make미역국. \r\nC: Do you have any special memories or experiences when you think about미역국?\r\nI: When I had a child…one of the home workers made me미역국. But the - that my family올캐 made was the best at the time. \r\nC: At that time?\r\nI: Yes, at that time. \r\nC: Why do you think that it was so special? \r\nI: This is just my opinion, but my 올캐 is a person who cooks very well. And also she probably made it with all her effort. The person who is working made it only because they have to…because it is their job. I feel that that is the difference.  \r\nC: Because of the added effort?\r\nI: Of course. There is a difference between making it because it is a task vs. putting in the effort with love.  \r\nC: What meaning does미역국hold for you?\r\nI: I gave birth to my child when I was traveling during the Korean War. At that time, food was very precious in Korea. There were many people who did not have the chance to eat미역국. But I was able to eat미역국as much as I wanted. I was in a special circumstance so that is why it is special. \r\nC: And…we are Korean immigrants who live in America. Why do you think that we continue to make and eat미역국in the states?\r\nI: That’s because it is a food that we ate since we were children. No matter which country you go to…people have attachments to their food due to the memories and familiar tastes. That is why we eat미역국.\r\nC: By eating and making미역국, do you think that we are more aware of being Korean?\r\nI: It can. I made미역국for my daughter-in-law when she gave birth. I sacked it and took it to the hospital. She usually eats the food that I make for her. She drinks the soup but she does not eat the stuffing. \r\nC: Because she is American?\r\nI: Yes. She doesn’t eat the seaweed or the other fillings…because she is American daughter-in-law. When I used to live with my son, I made미역국for my grandchildren. And every time she said that she could not eat the seaweed stuffing. She only drinks the soup. She eats all the other Korean dishes well…비빈밥, 잡체, 오징어…살마서 초 고추장에 찍어먹는거. She eats everything else well but she cannot eat the seaweed.\r\nC: Do you have any plans of teaching your grandchildren?\r\nI: Maybe not my grandson but to my granddaughter. My granddaughter didn’t marry yet but when she does, I should teach them. But, my grandchildren were all born here but when I or their mothers make미역국, they eat it well. \r\nC: 미역국is a traditional Korean food. If you were to rank 미역국from 1 (least) to 10 (most important) what would you say?\r\nI: So…food that you eat after giving birth…미역국is…\r\nC: 10?\r\nI: No. Korean people have the main idea that women should eat미역국after they give birth no matter what. So for people who had children, the first you eat is미역국, so it should be number 1.\r\nC: Oh, number 1 is the least and number 10 is the highest. \r\nI: Oh, then it should be 10. Even until today, Korean people…no matter where you go, women should eat미역국after giving birth.\r\nC: Even in the past, was미역국as precious?\r\nI: Not really. Seafood was easily attainable in Korea. What I mean when I say they were valuable is that during the war time, people were unable to go to the ocean to obtain the seaweed.\r\nC: Is there any other thing that you would like to say about미역국?\r\nI: Nothing special…I don’t know. Is there are difference between 다시마 and 미역? I like taking 다시마 and frying it like you fry chicken. When you take it out, you put on some salt, a little sugar…it’s so good. \r\nC: Ok, thank you, I think that is all. \r\nI: Ok. \r\n\r\n','Sun Hee Kim8 - Transcription.docx','application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.word',20856,1696067),(139,19,173,122,'Korean Seaweed Soup 1B','Audio','Computer Audio Recorder Program.

The saints will get up bed even it’s very late in the night and drive the saint to the hospital and translate for him and you know call the doctor I mean call they’ll try to find an insurance company that kind of things. Also, when the saint is in the hospital, all the other brothers and sisters will go to the hospital to visit him and cook food for him.\r\nY: you’re right. Very practical. Yea.

Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me for this interview. I have a few questions to ask you. Lets start with your first experience with Korean pop culture. How was your first encounter with Korean popular culture? \r\n\r\nS: My first encounter with Korean pop culture was probably at the end of high school or beginning of college for me which was around 2005. I actually didn\'t know what I was getting myself into when I first experienced it.\r\n\r\nT: What was your first encounter/experience with the Korean wave? Was it music, drama, fashion, etc. ?\r\n\r\nS: It was actually an online Korean game called Maple Story which is an role-playing game where you can chat and interact with other players of the game online. \r\n\r\nT: How did your online game develop into other aspects of Korean pop culture? or How did you become interested in Korean music and dramas?\r\n\r\nS: I became interested in Japanese popular culture because of my international (Japanese) friend before I was interested in Korean pop culture. I actually think my interested in J-pop was the gateway to my obsession with K-pop and everything else that is Korean related! I met another Korean friend in high school and would listen to Korean music with her during break times at school. When I got home from school I looked the groups up on youtube and would just browse other related artists from there. \r\n\r\nT: Did you understand any of the lyrics in the songs?\r\n\r\nS: No, I didn\'t know any Korean when I first started listening to K-pop. I would look up lyric translations online in order to understand but I just like the music because it sounded good to my ears. I would watch music videos with the lyric translation on youtube and the same goes for Korean dramas. \r\n\r\nT: Oh wow! How did your interest in Korean music draw you to Korean dramas?\r\n\r\nS: I watched my first Korean drama with one of my Korean friends. We watched the videos online with English subtitles and I was hooked!\r\n\r\nT: Do you like Korean food?\r\n\r\nS: I LOVE Korean food. When I meet up with my Korean friends I always suggest we get some kind of Korean food but they always want something else since they usually get Korean food at home. \r\n\r\nT: You don\'t think Korean food is too spicy?\r\n\r\nS: I can handle most Korean spicy as long as its not crazy spicy. I love the spicy Korean chicken. We should get some today!\r\n\r\nT: Did you have a lot of Korean friends growing up?\r\n\r\nS: I think I became friends with more and more Koreans after I got obsessed with Korean pop culture. Once I found out some of the people I met were Korean, I would talk to them about all of the Korean stuff I liked. I think the fact that we had similar interests made us closer since that was like the only thing we used to talk about!\r\n\r\nT: So most of your Korean friends were into Korean pop music and Korean dramas as well?\r\n\r\nS: Yes, I think I gravitated towards Korean people who were either born and raised in Korean or Korean-Americans who were somewhat in tone with their heritage.\r\n\r\nT: Would you say that your Korean-American friends identify themselves as American or Korean?\r\n\r\nS: I actually think neither. My friends aren\'t strictly Korean or American. They\'re Korean-American which takes aspects of both cultures. I feel like my Korean-American friends identify themselves as exactly that. \r\n\r\nT: Do you think your interest in Korean pop culture and the Korean Wave in general has changed your outlook on Koreans or Asians in general? If so, how?\r\n\r\nS: I think it has changed my perception on how I see Asians. You know there are some of the typical stereotypes like how Asian men aren\'t very masculine and how Asian women are submissive. I feel like a lot of Korean dramas depict very strong-willed and hard-working main female and male characters. Not only that but idol boy bands and girl groups portray an image that shows people that they are strong, smart, and extremely talented.','IMG_20120314_203407.jpg','image/jpeg',1272559,1786031),(143,24,18,98,'Joyce HATES Fortunetellers','Fieldnotes','Marisela will be represented with M and Joyce with J.\r\n\r\nM:so joyce can you tell me what part of Korea are you from?\r\nJ:Jeju island\r\nM:So What do you think of Fortune telling fortune tellers in Korea?\r\nJ:Crazy people, did u actually right that,  or are u writing something different. I do think they are crazy people who think they are talking to the other world, maybe they are ghost or ancestors which is ridiculous. Jeju island is the most craziest when it comesto believing the most in Korea when it comes to fortune telling and they believe that everything has as spirit/gods that talk to them. Many of the visiting places and stuff in jeju regards to myth or folklore stuff.\r\nM:can you tell me what is like traditional korean and what is new when it comes to fortune telling?\r\nJ;old and new? would be like western zodiac signs like scorpio is my type, blood types are fairly new and tarot cards obviously. Old, looking at the skies and judging by the stars,looking at your birthday and if u where born during the day or what time. Looking at the weather and dreams obviously.\r\nM:Can you explain to me the blood types im not really familar with that.\r\nJ:A is very timid, and they want to be perfectionist. B is very temper mental. AB is like the weird one , they are quiet and all but from AB you get the crazy geniuses. 0 is mild ill show u a website latter thats funny about blood types.

After like but this time like the whole, the activities you guys doing, are these activities enjoyable to you?\r\nJ: um.. well there is for all the people who are in the meeting.\r\nI: oh, is there like do you feel relaxed after all day I mean all days of school, there is no school, after all days of work,  do you feel relaxed in this kind of you know  fellowship, this kind of meeting?\r\nJ: um\r\nI: or you just simply feel happy and joyful?\r\nJ: yea I guess its quiet enjoyable and relax.\r\nI:oh , ok so, yea why you know because like school especially high school is already exhausting  and doing the weekend hey young people will just choose to go to a party or go shopping or watch a movie to relax but why do you choose to go to the meeting? I know its long, its about 3 hours. Like why do you do this over all the other things? What attracting you to go to the meeting?\r\nJ:well. Um. unlike my parents, I would go head rest, rest, then I still being considering think like three hours per week for the lord. Exluding The meeting that I go on Sunday. I think that it is so important that it is great to like spend my three hours toward the Lord. \r\nI: so you think it is worth it, right? Worth the time, right?\r\nJ:en\r\nI: oh. But do you also like hang out with friends in the church? Like is friend also a big factor that attracts you to go to the church? Because for some young people they say that they like to go to the church because their friends are there. They can just fellowship and hang out with friends. They feel that it is very enjoyable to them, do you feel the same way?\r\nJ: ...well you wouldn’t find it as attractive as the things…\r\nI:ya why are those activities you do meaningful to you? Like for example why is singing, praying, prophesizing meaningful to you? Does these create any meaning for you?\r\nJ: for me, a reminder especially from my daily lives. Like we don’t get out of contact with the Lord.\r\nI:so you guys don’t get to be taken away by the world. But just turn back to the Lord, right?\r\nJ:en\r\nI:I enjoyed that too. Like which part of the activities do you enjoy the most? The singing, praying or all the things. They are all enjoyable, no difference.\r\nJ:they’ re all the same.\r\nI: you need them all to enjoy the Lord to the uttermost right?\r\nJ:yea.\r\nI: can you share or do you still remember, Is there an meeting that was very impressive to you?

I mean if you were to make a ranking of your social life, church life and family life.\r\nJ: yea. If I don’t attend, I feel sluggish.\r\nI: sluggish, oh ok.\r\nJ: I think it is definitely important. \r\nI: do you have any companion or friends that you attend the meeting with?\r\nJ: companion from like Bible reading or morning revival, right?\r\nI: yea\r\nJ: yea, I don’t have any.\r\nI: you don’t have any, but you have tried to bring your friends to your meetings, right\r\nJ: yea, I have never done that.\r\nI: oh, Ok. But you get to meet a lot of new friends, brother and sisters in the meetings, right?\r\nJ: There is usually a lot of people.\r\nI: yea. You were the second generation of Christian, does the church life also play an important role in your family life? Like do your family members participate in the church together?\r\nJ: en.\r\nI: yea. That’s great. I think that’s about it. That’s all the questions I have right now.

Like how frequent do you attend the small group meeting?\r\nA: Once a week.\r\nI: How long have you been attending this small group meeting?\r\nA: Not the same group, but this kind of Friday home meeting, about 10 years.\r\nI: 10 years, so you started to attend, 2002?\r\nA: probably 2000.\r\nI: Do you still remember your first small group meeting?\r\nA: Yea.\r\nI: How did you feel at that time? How did you first join the small group meeting?\r\nA: My mother in law. She came. She visited from Korea. She came from Korea but she said I am gonna go to church. She was in church in Korea. Because at that time, I did not know you know local church meeting. I am really you know not aware of church. So how you gonna go church? I don’t know you know which church you should go. She said ok, someone gonna pick me up. She went to church meeting in LA. So when she went there, she asked me. I used to work my whole life, at that time I did not work because I was pregnant. So I didn’t woek on Sunday. Usually I work even Sunday. I did not work on Sunday because I was pregnant. I had one day off. So, she asked me go together. You know what usually like the Asian culture you do not say no to mother in law. So I said ok, so I attended the church and then honestly the church meeting was awesome, I really loved it from the first day I visited. In that meeting, people asked, ok, who where you live? And asked my mother in law to go to a home meeting. And someone asked and took mom to a home meeting. So I went with her together. Actually that is not my will just follow mother in law. Not the same as the church meeting, Lord’s day meeting. Home meeting was kind of awkward to me. It is because its more like intimate. I am not one who usually get friends right away. So it was you know the subject like about Bible and they share. It is kind of like a who are them? Why are they so friendly. Kind of feeling like Oh My God, what they doing ? I t looked awkward. I did not fit in there.\r\nI: why did you still going there, just because of your mother in law?\r\nA: why I continue at that time?\r\nI: yea. Did you continue to go after you first went there and felt awkward? \r\nA: about the very first period, you know a couple of weeks, because my mother in law still with us, you know she didn’t go to Korea. She stayed, so that’s the reason. After that the church, you know sisters and brothers they contact us, they continue contacts us, and then you know like human life, some concerns about you, you really cannot reject invitations. That’s why, they contacted us and then the other one is I attended Lord’s day church meeting , that was awesome. Lord’s table and prophesize meeting. So I thought this was Church, little different than other church, like they call. I couldn’t really refuse it. \r\nI: so now is totally different, right? Now you enjoy the small group meeting?\r\nA: right now, the reason is more like truth. So I saw in the church life, I saw the truth, you know our church life is not just attending prophesize meeting or Lord’s table meeting. That’s only a little part of the church life, but most of the part it is with brothers and sisters, saints, we…\r\nI: blending together\r\nA: yea.  I think that is part of church life. I also enjoy, I loved them. I love my sisters and brothers, they are more close than my actual sisters and brothers. They are all in Korea and Japan. So they are my sisters and brothers in here. Mostly the truth. You know the truth, that’s our church life. This is my church life. The Friday meeting is not meeting, it is my church life.\r\nI: among all those activities you guys do in the small group meeting. I know you guys do the singing, the prophesizing and you guys read the Bible, doing the testimony, right?\r\nA: yes. We read the Bible and share testimonies and share my experiences and sing together, sometimes sing hymns, but a lot of times, enjoyed is we talk. You know we talk about life issues. How did you spend your last week? And what happened to you? This is a very good chance you can know each others, you know each church members. Otherwise, it is very hard.\r\nI: so, you guys actually get to open up to share about yourself? Your daily lives, right?\r\nA: yea. We have a schedule, what we do is we read life study. Korean version of Life study. More than 10-12 years ago, we started from New testimony and we come back to old testimony and we went through every lesson, I think its more than ten years what we doing. So we read each chapter of life study.\r\nI: Wow.\r\nA: we are now Matthew 16. This week we share with Matthew 16. When its prophesize meeting, we shared two, one is morning revival, half of them is the life study, so we shared. But not only that we do a lot, we eat and we share and then yea.\r\nI: Do you guys share the burden? Like you have encountered any difficulties in real life. Do you guys tell each other and pray together?\r\nA: yes. We do. But that is little bit weak because we spent a lot time to reading and writing and sharing. Burden is a little bit weak in our meeting in our small group. So we have brother Andy and Brother choi and they said we should do share more about, sometimes we miss a lot of time.\r\nI: When you guys sharing, do you guys try to relate the Bible to yourself, to real life experience?\r\nA:oh yes. We do it in an opposite way. We share experience and related it on the Bible. We read the life study first and then we share based on what we read. You know this week, we shared about Matthew chapter 5. We talking about we are the light. \r\nI: That’s great.\r\nA: yea, you know we read it and we can experience what we read it. You know we share, yea, we share. One or the other way.\r\nI: when you guys shared out what have you experienced, this is also encouraging others.\r\nA: sure, we shared together testimonies, we share our experiences and then we eat together.\r\nI: you eat together.\r\nA: physically together. You know. Not only spiritually.\r\nI: When you guys eat, do you guys get to fellowship with each other also?\r\nA: Sure, always. Actually we have the teenagers, between 7, 8 to 13. We have different Korean girls. So we share. \r\nI: do you guys talk about work? Talk about family?\r\nA: yea we talk about not only Bible, but we talk about our families, we talk about our kids,  you know when you have children. We have children, we talk about. Yea, we share everything. We getting like more, we share more. We share more and we love more. What we share is, we not judging, we not. Its hard to provide like you know professional advices. But we share, I think that is more than enough. You cannot share all things with someone in the work. I think we should pretend. For my job, we have to pretend, but we really do not have to pretend in our meeting. \r\nI: Meeting is just like a family, you can just open up to share your real feelings to them? And they will help you and sometimes they have more experiences, they can help you and also encourage you.\r\nA: sure. Yes, I think so.\r\nI: that’s great.\r\nA: Because we change direction a lot and even nobody guides us, time pass, we are more open. Actually, we really cannot give them some kind of solutions. There is no solutions, but we just share, that’s encouraging each other. And when you share, you do not judge, you do not criticize about what you shared and then we just listen to each other. Yea, like a family. Yea, pretty good, nourishing and cherishing each other. I love this small group meeting.\r\nI: so the small group meeting actually is very important to you.\r\nA: yes, important to me. Sometimes, I don’t want to go, honestly, I don’t want to go a lot of times because I am so tired, but its good. Its hard to say.\r\nI: We all get up and go, right?\r\nA: yea. Usually, I usually hardly make it. When I finish work. I kept doing working but them I have to stop and go. My little girl love to go to the meeting. You know sometimes when she was young, she 11 at 6 grade right now. But still she miss it. She asked me like mommy, who house today meeting? When is our turn, she remembers and she love to go. It is a blessing to my girl. She likes to go to the meeting.  \r\nI: so you guys can, actually spending family time together, right? Doing the meeting\r\nA: Sure, yea. We do. Because sometimes you really cannot talk to husband what you mad about, but when you go to the meeting, you can talk. Of course, he is not going to yell at me. Because you know I would say today morning my husband did this this this, I was so mad, but I did not know my husband was mad at me. And then my husband said you must not mad, I just did that bla bla bla. It is also good this time to close to each other, husband and wife sometimes you cannot talk. But to others, you can open. Like Asian boys they cannot say I concerned about my wife. Even they don’t say. But in everybody together. Yea, I concerned about my wife. Its good to hear. They would never say I love my wife. They never ever say. But in everybody together,  yea, I love my wife.\r\nI: Is this also a reason that you’re still going to the meeting? Just to hear him?\r\nA: not, not really. The main reason is this is the church life, and it is not only a mission, but even you think it’s the church life, you don’t like it. You really do not go, but I go because I can say this is church life because when you go more you could see more truth and church, you know what is the reality. If you are not really attending church meeting, I think small group meeting, there is something missing. That is the reason. Because we talk about that  church is the body, but you are only one single person and, one direction, if you do it one by one, you really cannot see it. When you are group together, you are one and you can see. You know its good.\r\nI: I know that you have been attending this small group meeting for about 10 years already. Among all of these meeting, is there  any of them that is so impressive that you still remember?\r\nA: so impressive?\r\nI: yea. Like maybe you were touched by some testimonies and you were touched by just some words from the Bible you know that just fit your needs. You felt that the Lord has spoken to you.\r\nA: Ok, I have to be honest, most touched by you know, small group right now, I think this is the best, but I went through 2, 3 different small groups meetings. I am gonna say more touched by for small group meeting is not  actually truth, but more impressive about the sisters and brothers concerned about other brothers and sisters. This is really impressive. When the first small group and they are brothers and sisters, the couple, they prepare meal for me because I finish working at 7 o’ clock. I did not want to go at 7 o’clock. Because especially at that time I was the new one. Even what they say on  the church meeting, in Sunday. That one touched me. Cause my first church meeting was we, they talked about you know Triune God. So I say, because I do not have any background of  any Christian life. I was Catholic a little bit when I was in high school 3, 4 years. But I am not Christian background. I did not have, maybe they tell me. At the first meeting in LA, they talked about the Triune God. Ad I heard everything, I was Oh My God. So true, its so amazing, Wow. And then my mother gave me 《God’s Economy 》. First book I read is 《God’s Economy》. I read it, its awesome. Oh My God. I read it again again again. You know more like touched by the words in the prophesize meeting, but the m family small group meeting was touched me for the first meeting group. The brothers and sisters, they prepared a meal for me. Because the meal is not awesome, but she called me Thrusday, Friday and she asked me  if a, we prepare a meal for you.  I cannot,  whenever its go. At that time I cannot, I was just husband and me. It was 7 o’ clock. Sometimes, I finished at 7:30. And 8 o’clock meeting is too much. And I really did not want to go because physically I am tired.  I working almost 7 days. Sometimes I am one day off, usually Wednesday. Friday is still sounds long until net Wednesday. So, she prepared a meal for me and then. Sometimes I said wrong, they just say, oh Ok. We know our church little by little. sometimes you got it wrong and sometimes you know  already, but I just found it, I was like amazing. Wow, then I started to talking all day long, because I did not know what the Bible said, everything is  done by Him. God already finish everything. And what we are doing, we are, how do I say, cannot find the word. You know what I mean. \r\nI: yea.\r\nA: God already done his economy, our …will not gonna change what he already done.  We know in the end, what he already done. We are just applying  what he is done.\r\nI: yea.\r\nA: I can be ours, so I was sorry I was talking all day long, they listen. I think it is touch me, they listen ,so I did not have not much background, but when I have a little small vision, the church they brought the pastors(?) and they blessing and they pray. And they talk, I listen. And you know that’s what they doing, they talk, I listen. After that I prepare a meal for them. Yea. I didn’t know because I didn’t have the background,  I did not know at that time, they  have to come to the business,  after that we eat together. We have to give them money, I did not know that. Actually I show them bad manners, I did not know. But just treat them love. I found that later on. They said they prepare a meal for me and then whenever I talk, I think a lot of time I did it wrong, but they said ok. Because they encourage me to pursue the Bible and the truth. That was it touched me. So I remembered it. And therefore the other words, God’s words, what they shared. I can’t remember all of them. Too many. Too many. That’s the most impressive one.\r\nI: Sister, thank you for sharing with me. That also encourage me too, yea.\r\nA: Thank you.\r\n','Anna Yang.m4a','audio/m4a',4289445,1768342),(151,24,133,101,'Grace, baby and LACC','Fieldnotes','I am represented as M and Grace is G\r\n(her baby is 4 months old and is very adorable, he sleeps most of the time, according to Grace).\r\n\r\nM:Ok ill try to make it ask quick as possible so you can go back home with the baby ask fast as possible.\r\nG:ok dont worry i can have her dad pick us up.\r\nM:ok, what part of Korea are you from?\r\nG:I wasn\'t born in Korea, I was born in Los Angeles, CA \r\nM:ok, what kind of images do you think of when you think of fortune telling?\r\nG:Images and ideas, form a shaman in my mind, when I see it in a Korean perspective.\r\nM: Ok do you know about  the different blood types?\r\nG:(A) sensitive (B) rude/blunt(AB) “two-faced”(O) indifferent\r\nM: yey they are all sounding the same\r\nG:what?\r\nM:oh i mean that everyone is giving me like the same answers.\r\nG:ok thats good right\r\nM:i think, haha, ok so what do you think about double eye lids or in general, physical characteristics defining a person?\r\nG:If you have double eyelids, you wouldn\'t have to spend money, like the people who don\'t  have double eyelids.

(have you ever seen a fortune teller). \r\n\r\nI remember fortunetellers always having old books with folk paintings and charts or objects like knives and/or sticks. The fortunetellers always seemed intimidating if not sinister.\r\n\r\n3)What kinds of fortune telling is considered new and old? Such as tarot readings, horoscope etc. \r\n\r\nI consider the old style using traditional objects or the fortunetellers themselves being mediums. I see new style blending Western objects and symbols with traditional Korean elements and interpretations. \r\n\r\n4)What personalities are represented in blood types?\r\nA,B,AB etc. \r\n\r\nI don’t consider it seriously so I don’t know much about them but AB’s are supposed to be hyper. I know this only bc it’s my own blood type.\r\n\r\n5) If a person is born with double eye lids what are they considered to be? Is there any other physical characteristics that you know that defines a person? \r\n\r\nI don’t have any stereotypes about a person with double eye lids but the Korean expression “눈값 하다” literally, “to pay the worth one’s eyes” is a warning against someone who has extremely slanted or sharp looking eyes. So reading about such characters in literature was a foreshadowing of their vengeful nature.\r\n\r\n6)Do you know about the different dragons represented in Korea? Such as the black dragon, green dragon, etc. \r\n\r\nI usually visualize dragons as being green holding a crystal ball that supposes grants wishes.\r\n\r\n7)Is there any particular aspect ( manner, reason) in fortune telling that you believe is different in Korea than other?\r\n\r\nMore than ever, I think it’s considered so much a part of Korea’s everyday life. It’s very ambiguous bc it’s both taken seriously but not.

I have a few questions about your experience with the Korean wave. What was your first encounter with Korean pop culture?\r\n\r\nD: My parents used to watch a lot of Korean dramas and movies with english or vietnamese subtitles. So back around the end of middle school or beginning of high school for me. My siblings and I would watch with them. \r\n\r\nT: How did your parents get a hold of the dramas and movies? Were they online or did you guys watch them on the TV?\r\n\r\nD: My parents actually sold them so they would just bring them from their store. At that time my mom had a store that sold all kinds of Asian dramas and movies with subtitles and Vietnamese music CDs. If there was anything we wanted to watch we would just ask them if we could bring it home to watch. I remember there was this one drama called \"Autumn in My Heart\" my older siblings and I were obsessed with the soundtrack so we would play it over and over in the car wherever we went!\r\n\r\nT: Did you understand any of the lyrics in the songs?\r\n\r\nD: No, I don\'t know a lot of Korean except for the words that my friend who is also my roommate told me more recently but the music sounded so good so it didn\'t really matter to us. \r\n\r\nT: Did you listen to other Korean music other than the drama soundtrack?\r\n\r\nD: Not on a regular basis but my roommate is Korean so I listen to whatever she plays on her itunes. I have to admit though, K-pop is pretty catchy. I notice myself recognizing a lot of the music when I go out to Koreatown with friends and sometimes I have random choruses from Korean songs stuck in my head. \r\n\r\nT: Did you have a lot of Korean friends growing up?\r\n\r\nD: I didn\'t have a lot of Korean friends during my childhood but I have a lot more Korean friends now. My roommate is also my really close friend so I met a lot of Korean people when we joined a Korean Catholic Club at UCLA. \r\n\r\nT: Are most of your Korean friends into their Korean culture?\r\n\r\nD: Yes, I think my Korean friends and even Korean-American friends are very cultured and not all of them but I think most of them like Korean music and pop culture.\r\n\r\nT: Would you say that your Korean-American friends identify themselves as Korean or American?\r\n\r\nD: I think my Korean-American friends would identify themselves with \"Korean-American culture\". I think they are very different from Koreans from Korea. The culture is different here, they still have strong ties with their heritage but when it comes down to it I think they are their own entity, do you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nT: Yeah of course I do. I would say the same thing for myself as a Korean-American. How about food? Do you like to eat Korean food? and if so, what is your favorite?\r\n\r\nD: I do like Korean food. My whole family loves to eat Korean food. I live close to the Korean district in Garden Grove in Orange County, so my family likes to eat all kinds of food from there. We usually go to eat all you can eat Korean BBQ, spicy soft tofu soup, or the Korean style friend chicken and pizza. \r\n\r\nT: Do you like kimchi?\r\n\r\nD: I love kimchi! My Korean roommate thinks its so funny how much I like kimchi. She always tells me that I eat more kimchi than her own sisters!

When my parents came to live in the US I moved with them to Los Angeles. I think because my parents never adapted fully to American culture, I grew up with very strong ties to my culture. \r\n\r\nT: So ever since you were younger you listened to Korean music and watched dramas? \r\n\r\nS: I think so. I can\'t remember the first time I watched Korean dramas or listened to Korean music. I think I even grew up watching Korean cartoons and children\'s tv shows.\r\n\r\nT: So when you were growing up you understood Korean?\r\n\r\nS: Yeah, my parents never took English classes so they only spoke to me in Korean. I basically grew up speaking Korean at home and English when I was away from home like at school or with friends. \r\n\r\nT: Did you have a lot of Korean friends while growing up?\r\n\r\nS: I believe I did. I grew up with a lot of Korean-Americans who I met through my church and we were really close. I did have non-Korean friends also though. \r\n\r\nT: Did you speak Korean or English with your Korean-American friends? \r\n\r\nS: We usually spoke English. Almost all of them were born and raised in the US so they only spoke Korean with their parents and some of them rarely spoke Korean at all. \r\n\r\nT: Were you more comfortable speaking English or Korean growing up?\r\n\r\nS: I would have to say I was more comfortable with English. My parents would always make me help them with things they didn\'t understand in English like dealing with the bank or asking for help at a store and even simple things like ordering food. I think I did it for them because a part of me also was a little bit embarrassed.\r\n\r\nT: Why were you embarrassed?\r\n\r\nS: I don\'t know why but I felt like people would judge me or treat me differently because my parents couldn\'t speak english very well and had accents. Most of the time even if my parents would speak to me in Korean out in public, I would respond back in English and they would get really upset at me because of that. \r\n\r\nT: Then would you say that you identify yourself as strictly American or Korean? Or do you think there is a separate Korean-American culture?\r\n\r\nS: Even though I was born in Korea, I wouldn\'t Identify myself as just Korean. I think if I grew up in Korea and never moved here I would be a completely different person than who I am today. My parents are pretty traditional Koreans and are very adamant that I stay close to my Korean heritage. They never want me to forget where I\'m from but when it comes down to it I would have to say I would identify myself as Korean-American. We\'re just different not in a good or bad way but just different in a sense that I grew up in a different society which changed my outlook on a lot of things. \r\n\r\nT: Okay, so what do you think about the surge popularity that Korean pop culture is currently having?\r\n\r\nS: I kind of like that people are becoming more open to experiencing some of our pop culture. Maybe it could change some of the typical Western stereotypes or the negative images on East Asians.

I saw people fortune telling based on their birthday what time there where born and also fortune telling of the week and month and when people get married they go get their fortune told to see if they are the right couple which is also ridiculous. When they build a house they do poongshi, which is like the ying and yang,they do it by the direction which is good or bad for the people living there.\r\nM:What kinds of fortune telling is considered new and old? Such as tarot readings, horoscope etc. \r\nS:what do you mean new style\r\nM: you know like tarot cards, westernized stuff\r\nS: oh ok well that and umm.....the old style of fortune telling is people through rice and look at the rice to see what they can find from there.\r\nM: that one i didnt know, what personalities are represented in blood types?\r\nS:A is tend to think to much and they often not get angry but get stacked up inside of them, and then get angry all of a sudden, they get sad pretty easily, picky, they think to much\r\nB simply describe as bad person , they are too straight forward, selfish way beyond straight (he is A but he resembles B)\r\nAB psycho or very intelligent negative or positive, so they live in their fantasy world they are AB\r\n0 is very generous they are able to take in and blend in with others.\r\nM:5) If a person is born with double eye lids what are they considered to be?

Such as the black dragon, green dragon, dragons that cannot fly?\r\nS:A dragon that cannot fly is not a dragon, the imugi, you know imugi, cannot fly because they do not have the ball of yuhjin (its like a pearl that completes them) and dragons are green. Korean dragons don’t have wings and don’t blow up fire like western dragons they controls everything, nature, the weather and stuff like that.\r\nM:Is there any particular aspect in fortune telling that you believe is different in Korea than other?\r\nS:Matt asked me about the dreams what unique is that I can dream of you like getting pregnant a fish going into u or a dragon taking me up high that  represents having a kid if a person. so if a person  who wants to get pregnant they can buy a dream from the person who had a dream of them and they get that dream.

Like when is the small group meeting?\r\nA: we gather every Friday. Starts at 8 o’ clock. \r\nI: 8 o’ clock. And 8 to 10 or?\r\nA: the meeting starts at a time but no ending time. \r\nI: No ending time.\r\nA: If you want to stay together more than, maybe sometimes we stay in like 11. Because the day is Saturday. Most of the brothers and sisters do not work. Saints get together enjoy each other.\r\nI:yea. So also like friends just chatting and have fun with each others, right?\r\nA: yea. Friends not only in a regular daily lives, but also in divine life, Christian life. You know we feel like friends.\r\nI: where do you guys meet?\r\nA: where do we meet? Actually, we meet in saints’ home. We take turn every month. So my small group has 4 families. So we take turn you know every moth a family open their house.\r\nI: How many people are there in your small group meeting?\r\nA: We have 9. Actually you know we have 5 young people, the children. That small group meeting is for adult’s sake, not young people. but because you cannot let them stay home alone, we bring them to the meeting. But, they also enjoy that life, you know, get stay together, play together, but believing they also enjoy the time.\r\nI:  You guys drive to the sister and brother’s house. Is there anyone pick up brothers and sisters who doesn’t have a car?\r\nA: Everyone have a car. But you know sometimes we bring our neighbor and friends. Some of them are believers, some are not believers, but sometimes we invite them. Every Friday night, before we start the meeting we eat together. Mostly, the hosting family prepare the food. Before we start the meeting, we eat together. Sometimes, not everyday but sometimes we brings our friends and neighbors.\r\nI: so you guys eat before you start the meeting.\r\nA: yes. Sometimes we’ll have a meeting with eating. Yea. There is no rule. Because small group meeting in Friday is home meeting. It’s like a home. You know at home, we eat, we do everything, right? Mostly we have dinner together before meeting, but still we eat some snacks, drink, we do Bible study whole we eating. It’s so relaxable.\r\nI: for the food you guys eat, do everyone bring food from home or do you guys cook food together?\r\nA: not really, I just tell you the host family prepare the food and snack. Sometimes you know you feel free to bring snacks and foods. Because most families work on Friday. The meeting starts at 8, sometimes the saints have no chance to eat. That’s why we prepare food for them, but most people enjoy eating together before  we start the meeting.\r\nI: are these food mainly Korean food?\r\nA: mostly Korean food, but sometimes the hosting families cook spaghettis, noodles, mostly Korean food.\r\nI: so while you guys eating, you said that there’s a meeting going on. You guys fellowship with each other while you guys eating. What kind of things do you guys usually fellowship?\r\nA: we talk about our daily lives and also what we enjoyed. What we read for morning revival, about the message we pursuing. Actually at home meeting,  we read the life study together. Right now we’re pursuing the book of Matthew, we talk about Matthew. Anything, there is no specific topics. But at the meeting, we have one hour Bible study time, so we are doing life study, while we’ re reading the life study, we focus on the life study, the book of Matthew. We talk about it, we ask each other, we answer each other. After that you know we freely enjoy each other by talking about our daily lives, talking about our children, our job, everything.  But everybody try to stay in Christ. You know what I mean, not in a worldly way, but in a way in Christ. It is really enjoyable, really nice.\r\nI: do you guys open up to each other to fellowship your difficulties. And try to relate the difficulties to Christ?\r\nA: yea, definitely.\r\nI: can you share with me some of the fellowship you remembered about the daily lives?\r\nA: You know every families have their own children, some children are in college, some in high school. So our children maybe our main issue, main subject. All their school life, all their church life. We always share our experiences. It is good for us. We share our experience so the young parents may learn something from the age parents. Old parents may have more experience. We learn something from their experience. Like my children have some troubling with school life. So I open my children’s problems to our saints.  They pray for me, they share their experience with similar situation. So It really helped to work with children to solve an bad issue or problems. It really works very well, so I really appreciated it. Actually you know when we have the experience from you know we did to help somebody else, right? So sharing our experience is a really really good fellowship. Especially we all come to each other, so not only talking about my problems, but also teach me other’s problems, so we face together. That’s a really good experience for me. And my son is really doing well right now.\r\nI: Besides like fellowshipping and sharing experiences, after the small group meeting.\r\nA: after the small group meeting, sometimes we talk about, you know blend together, sometimes we blend to have camping. Actually after the actual meeting, we really we really mingle the time. Just like a family. If somebody wants to go some place or entertainment to go with somebody else, then we’ll , we can blend together and go together. That’s why sometimes we stay you know longer than 2 hours, three hours.\r\nI: because you guys just enjoy chatting with each other.\r\nA: yea that’s why. Really good.\r\nI: I heard that one time, this testimony that one time, there was a brother, and he was an immigrant from and he doesn’t have\r\nA: yea, that’s why. We’re all immigrants, you know, some families have their siblings and relatives lives near their place, but for our small group, all families are immigrant and we don’t have families and siblings in CA. so we are, actually I am, they’re my brothers and they’re my sisters. Yea. We really feel like a family.\r\nI: so, now is less homesickness right?\r\nA: yea.\r\nI: do you still remember how did you first join the small group meeting?\r\nA: that’s about long time ago, that’s about 18 years ago. In Georgia, actually you know my wife and I were in the denomination, so one of my wife’s best friend was in the church in Fullerton. My wife step by CA after she departed Korea and she joined one meeting. So because it really touched her, so when she come back to Georgia. Her friend introduced her, one family in the church, they invite her to the home meeting, but I didn’t go.  I didn’t like it, but my wife went there. Then she really enjoyed that home meeting, but, actually I didn’t like the style of the home meeting. But one day after my wife attended the home after the home meeting, she shared what she really enjoyed, so it really touched me. So I decided to go there just for once. When I went to the meeting, actually at that time, I was a student, they were all Cal poly students, actually they were in the Face book. I met them in the college actually. That quiet surprise me. I didn’t expect them to be there, but they were, a couple of brothers were in that meeting and they shared a lot about the Christ and the Bible and then you know. They have high knowledge. They know a lot about the Bible, about Christ. They were only trainee, trainee 1, trainee 2. Very young brothers, but what they speaking about the Christ is really really high. That touched me and then. Actually I didn’t intended to continue to going the home meeting, but I changed my minds, you know I go to there every week. The first home meeting was really touched me and then those brothers encouraged me a lot and I decided to continue go to the meeting. Then that’s why I am still in the church.\r\nI: you are still in the church, so now you go to the small group meeting as possible as you can, right?\r\nA: yes.\r\nI: so how frequent do you attend?\r\nA: oh, every week. Once a week, every Friday.\r\nI: Since you first went to the meeting to now?\r\nA: yea. Since about 18 years ago, maybe 1994.\r\nI: 1994.\r\nA: sometimes, you know I miss. I try not to miss that meeting. I really enjoyed it. \r\nI: so you think this is very important to you , the group meeting?\r\nA: oh, yea. It is. Because that small group meeting, that meeting keep me not only enjoying Christ in the church life and also in a continuous mutual nourishing and cherishing in home, you know the daily lives. Actually the mutual nourishing and cherishing is in the home. I believe you know we enjoy each other in the meeting, the Lord’s day, but the home meeting is more enjoyable. Home meeting is really important for our church life.\r\nI: do you think is that because in the home meeting, there are less people, so people can actually get to know each other better, right?\r\nA: that’s also we enjoyed what they enjoyed. By sharing our enjoyment, we can enjoy the Christ in various ways.\r\nI: so do you think you gonna continue to go to the meeting?\r\nA: yea, I am.\r\nI: like, do you have a is there a main reason that’s  attracting you this much to go the meeting?\r\nA: well, firstly, so enjoyable. I don’t want to miss it. So enjoyable. And then as I told you throughout the home meeting, it may be hard to say, the enjoyment of Christ. I think the home meeting might be the basic, not just the basic but must go meeting for our church life.\r\nI: must go meeting for our church life. Do you get to spend time with your children, with your family in the small group meeting?\r\nA: as I told you yea sometimes, but mostly that meeting is for adult’s sake.\r\nI:oh yea yea yea.\r\nA: our children goes to the children’s meeting on Saturday. But they stay with us during the home meeting. Now my kids, they are in junior high, when they are young, you know fourth grader, second grade. You know before we start the meeting we sing with them together. We sang children’s song. We could enjoy the singing together. But they go to the children’s meeting pretty much our Friday home meeting pretty much for adult’s sake.\r\nI: is there one small group meeting that has been very impressive to you? And you still remember it.\r\nA: Yes. For the home meeting, as I told you, you know I believe the home meeting help me stay in the church life.\r\nI: so you said that it helps you stay in the church life?\r\nA: Yea, it helped me a lot.\r\nI: Thank you brother, I think that is about all the\r\nA: All right.

Ruth comments.\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nI started with asking Angela all the questions I had asked Ruth.\r\n\r\nWhat she (Angela) looks for in a prospective marriage is a husband with a stable job, good sense of maturity, and the knowledge of the Korean language ( doesn\'t hurt but helps). Her mother had really wanted her to marry a Korean whether a Korean from Korea or an American Korean. Angela\'s mom does not want a language barrier. Even when Angela jokingly said, what if she married a white guy and just taught him Korea. Her mom replied, your Korean isn\'t that good. How are you suppose to teach him? And what if he doesn\'t like Korean food. Angela said her mom reluctantly gave and said it was okay to marry anyone. \r\n\r\nAngela unlike Ruth is an only child. Ruth has two other sisters one older and one younger.\r\n\r\nAngela would consider herself an old maid about 32-35.  And her ideal age for marriage is 26. Ruth interjected to say 35 is too old.\r\n\r\nShe expressed that she wouldn\'t want to marry anyone with the same last name as her. Choi. In my opinion I think this hints on some cultural taboos of Korea. Also she said that people with the surname Choi usually have bad temperaments.\r\n\r\nShe would rather have her husband be more matrilineal rather than patrilineal just because she\'s an only child. \r\n\r\nRuth mentions that she would not want to marry a fob (fresh off the boat) especially a fob Korean because she find them more conservative, the jealous type, hypocritical, horrible temperment and a sense of traditional roles in the opposite sex.

She considers herself much more of Japanese. She is fluent in Japanese and English but a little bit of Korea. She wanted  to study Korean and its culture so went to Korea and studied for a year a few years ago. She currently studies abroad in the U.K.\r\n\r\nHer parents’ background\r\nHer father, the second generation as Korea immigrants in Japan, is the third son and got married to a Korean woman (her mother). Her father’s brothers only got married to a Korean women. Her father’s father and mother can’t speak Japanese. Her father went to Korean school in Nagoya, where a lot of Korean people lived and institutions existed. So my father and mother have relatively strong identity as Korean ethnicity.\r\n\r\nHer parents’ idea about marriage\r\nHer parents have a relatively flexible idea towards their children’s’ marriage; their partner can be whoever she/he is nice and takes good care as a life partner not mattering ethnicity. But her parents’ real hope for them she thinks is to marry a Korean person because they would like to preserve the lineage of Korean ethnicity. They would never forcefully introduce a certain person pushing her to marry.\r\n\r\nHer Relatives’\r\nHer most relatives who live in Nagoya, however, do introduce her a Korean guy not only considering that they want to preserve Korean ethnicity but also they would like a connection within Korean community through her marriage.\r\n\r\nKorean society’s in Japan\r\nAs well as discrimination settled down with time passes generation to generation, she says the idea towards international marriages have definitely been changing. In her parents’ generation, there was still quite strong discrimination by Japanese, so they were not even thinking about marriage with non-Korean, especially Japanese. Her grandparents definitely won’t allow the oldest son to marry to Japanese person.\r\nBut in her generation, the idea is much loosed up. Yet, she thinks she would marry to Korean man because of the elaborate traditions and cultural practices that she, grown up in Japan, does’t even know to follow as a wife: preparing at the kitchen a few days before the New Year’s day. Looking at her mother’s back of that has been making me wonder if she could do the same thing as her. So she will consider who to marry concerning more of what she will have to do after the marriage.\r\n\r\nHer Korean friends’\r\nWhen she home-stayed in one house in Korea a few years ago, one girl who was three younger than Yeongsoon, told her that she wants to marry to a foreigner. She was saying that foreigners are handsome, nice and cool, and she wants to speak English very much.\r\nIn the U.K, she met one official (public servant) man who told her that he wants to find a Korean woman to get married.\r\nIt sounded like Japan she said, there are many people say that “after all, I want a Japanese person to marry. Japanese person would better match with me.”\r\n\r\nHer interpretation\r\nBecause of the age and changes, she would assume that there have been a lot more international marriages, but maybe much harder for a Korean to marry to a Japanese or Chinese person.\r\nA lot of Koreans believe in Christianity, and she thinks maybe because Korean people might feel closer to Caucasian people by what they believe in common.\r\nThe ads with foreign pictures were prohibited until 1980s or 1990s in Korea; after it has been released then, the Western booming dramatically started in the Korean society. Because of those rapid images of Western people, Korean people’s perceiving towards Western would become more of sense of longing, she argues.\r\nShe thinks Korean people consider similarly to Japanese parents would think today that they care whether they will be able to communicate well in different languages or keep their ethnic traditions, etc. and that she thinks as well.\r\n\r\nHer Conclusion\r\nShe wants to be with someone who at least can communication with her family members. She concerns her idea the most when it comes down to marriage, but she wants someone who understands her parents’ idea: someone who would be willing to learn Korean in order to communicate with her parents. She then told me “so maybe the parents’ idea the most.” \r\nWhen it comes down to the marriage, she considers more on a sense of value for marriages. With sense of value matched, it’s more of “he happened to be this ethnicity,” she said.','120311_Yeongsoon.MP3','audio/mp3',39333220,1848346),(168,13,82,158,'Hana- International Marriage','Audio','Audio File URL (Part 1 & 2): http://www.box.com/s/afc1e137e00825d6af7c\r\nhttp://www.box.com/s/3ac0928294ce4c777a17\r\n\r\nHer background information\r\nShe is a 58 year old Korean woman who was born and grown up in Korea until she moved to the U.S 26 years ago. She is married to a Japanese guy for 15 years now as a second marriage. Her family was wealthy and different from other Korean citizens. Her parents were a lot more flexible thinkers and open-minded towards globalization and society than other citizens at that period. She had married twice.\r\n\r\nHer 1st Marriage\r\nShe first got married to a Korean man 36 years ago from now and 10 years later, she and her ex-husband moved to the U.S together because of her ex-husband\'s business. However, because he lacked of the ability to well assimilate to an American life and society and also a money trouble between him and her, they divorced after a year of their life in the U.S. She said \"He was a very typical old-fashioned Korean man… very conservative, which everyone in Korea was back then… and that didn\'t match with my style because I was much more open-minded especially in a totally new environment.\" With her familial background, her family didn\'t disagree with her divorce and second marriage which both were extraordinary to be taken place in a Korea society at that time. At that time of divorce, they had already two children, a son and daughter, at that time. She told me that her ex-husband all of sudden went back to Korea with their children without her knowing which made her extremely shocked. She then went back to Korean as well to get her children back which she did at the end. She had to go through depression and sickness sometimes after her divorce. She said \"Maybe divorce wouldn\'t have happened if I didn\'t come to America. Because he was just one of those guys in Korean that they want their wives in the house and do the housework. I wasn\'t that way. I for the first time realized the gap between me and him when I came to America after spending about 10 years with him.\"\r\n\r\nHer 2nd Marriage (Now)\r\nShe had a second marriage to a Japanese man whom she met through business she started after her divorce in the U.S. She remembers and told me \"He couldn\'t speak Korean, I couldn\'t speak Japanese… we just had \'feelings\' between us. When we first met, we used to talk a lot even though we don\'t have a mutual language… even the whole night at the bar all the way to the morning. Even without language, we felt very connected and I felt such different from my ex-husband.\" Regardless of their relationship, two were living separately for ten years until they were married. Then finally, when her son started a college, two got married as one of marks of the family\'s life stage.\r\nHis family was not strict either,\" she says. He went back to Japan before their marriage by himself and told his parents about two. After his parents accepting, Sookhee and her husband both went to Japan to see his family. She says they were all nice at the engagement party. \r\n\r\nHer Parents \r\nSookhee’s parents had a very different style and idea about their education from typical Korean families of those days. Her grandfather\'s occupation was a governmental officer who served to Japan during the colonial period. And that made her father go to Japan to study when he was a student. Her father then worked at a trade company where he traveled over the world and stayed in the U.S for a long time. When she was in high school and it was strictly ruled not to have a relationship at school, her parents didn’t bother. She used to call her friend to have a social party at the basement bar of the house which her father built for his hobby. Her parents never scolded her for what she does with her friends, social and school behaviors. She says “Now that I think why my parents were so open-minded and globalized, I can say my father’s occupation was certainly a key factor.” Her parents had the same stance when it came down to her divorce and second marriage. They didn\'t disagree with her decisions which both divorce and second marriage with children were extraordinary to be held in Korean society at that time. Growing up with her parents’ philosophy of that, Sookhee herself never educated her children strictly or forcefully, either. Although she still let her son go to Kumon, English tutor or swimming school, that was to build an educational situation for him to do at least the standard at school. Especially the English was for him to learn it better since there was not much occasion for her son to use or know English until elementary school. Now, her son is 33 years old and is fluent in both Korean and English. Even though Sookhee had an idea in her head that she wants her son to do better at school or go to a better school, she never pushed or forced him for what to do.\r\nThe reason that both her son and daughter behaved quite good could be probably because they could perceive Sookhee’s efforts on raising them, young as they were, and the way she educated them made them more independent and mature. \r\n\r\nHer fundamental Idea about marriage\r\nShe doesn\'t care any race or ethnics to marry to, but it was more of feeling that she felt in him. Her family and herself were not kind of people who care about the reputation of society or what is right or wrong. \"If I would have felt something special to someone, my family made me ready to go with him.\"\r\n\r\nHer life after\r\nShe told me that sometimes she feels a little disappointed that she is unable to fully communicate with neither her husband nor her children because of the language barrier. She says \"I wonder how that could be or I would feel only if I would have married to a Korean guy though in my husband way that I like.\"\r\nEven though there are certain moments that makes her wonder about her marriage, she surely feels happy and content at most of her current life.\r\n\"I appreciate how great my current husband had taken care of my children even before our marriage, especially financially. He wouldn\'t have bothered the way I educated children at all and he just kind of watching over with a kind care. He absolutely trusted me.\"\r\n\r\nShe also talked about the Korean society before her immigration and contemporary characteristics from her point of view with some examples of her own children who are Korean American and fully assimilated to the mainstream society of America.','','',0,0),(169,44,202,166,'Stories of a Non-Korean\'s Experiences in Korea #2','Audio','S: Alright, this is Sunday, February 26th at 9:39 PM and I’m interviewing Professor T for my Korean Folklore project. So, hello.\r\nT: Hi.\r\nS: How are you doing?\r\nT: Oh I’m doing great. It’s a little late, but kids are asleep and I watched a little bit of the Academy Awards so.\r\nS: Oh yeah\r\nT: Yeah, it’s funny because I never go see movies. So it was really completely a bizarre experience because I didn’t know if I should be happy or unhappy with who won.\r\nS: Yeah, but you get to see pretty dresses.\r\nT: Yeah, my daughter is really into the pretty dresses.\r\nS: I guess, so I was really interested in the topic of non-Koreans and their experiences in Korea. Just because I think that they have very unique stories to tell. So I was kind of interested in how you even got interested in Korea to begin with.\r\nT: Long story, but I think a funny story. So, I knew nothing about Korea even when I was in grad school. When I was in college, I studied folklore and mythology which is kind of like what we’re doing right now. I was interested in anthropology but I wasn’t that interested in monkeys and so there was a lot of physical anthropology but it didn’t really appeal to me so I ended up doing storytelling and folklore and mythology. And I was very interested in pre-Christian Scandinavian religion, or so I thought I was, at least I was moderately in it. And so I was writing my senior thesis on Shamanism and aspects of Shamanism in Pre-Christian Scandinavian religion and the problem with it was that I started to realize that a lot of the stuff I was reading was pretty old. Like the fieldworks. And they didn’t really seem to reveal any sort of knowledge of (?) communities, and at the same time, it seemed pretty clear to me that no one really knew what was going on in Scandinavia a thousand years ago. Nevertheless, one of my professors convinced me not to go to law school, which was what I really was planning on doing and he said I should go to graduate school at least for a few years, because there was no rush, and people would pay me to live in California. And I thought, well that sounds like a pretty good deal. I used to be a pretty avid cyclist, so I figured I’d go off to California. And bicycle. You know, and maybe learn a few things along the way. And I was at grad school, at Berkeley for a couple of years and to be honest, I didn’t like it. I ended up studying early Scandinavian, old Norse stuff and I was still working on Shamanism in Scandinavia and I was studying for my exams (?) because I wouldn’t know if one would come in and bit me on my toe. So I was wandering around the hallways you know trying to figure out what I should do, and it was very late at night like two in the morning or something like that. And I was just kind of reaching the decision that yes, I should really now go to law school. And it didn’t seem bad or good to me. It just seemed like at least a plan. And I stumbled across a poster that was advertising a fellowship for people who know nothing about Asia to go to Asia for a year. And I thought hey, that sounds great, I know nothing about Asia and they will send me to Asia for a year. That will be great time to get just some various experience and maybe take— I like to do a lot of photography—so maybe I’d take some nice photographs— and apply to law school. So that was the plan. So I applied for this fellowship, and weirdly, I won it. \r\nS: Wow\r\nT: They asked me, where do you want to go? In Asia?\r\nS: So you had an option?\r\nT: And I don’t know anything about Asia. And they said, well you could go to Bali and study something called gamalon which is a gong music, which actually is like a cliché in ethnomusicology. I mean, it’s almost like… I don’t know what an equivalent would be, but it would be cliché. They also suggested that I could go and go to Taiwan where I could work in the ministry of tourism and help them make movies about traditional Taiwanese dance. And I thought nah, I don’t want to do that because Chinese is a really hard language. And yeah, I was a little bit wrong there. Or they said I could go work on a government certification squad in Korea, and I thought that just sounded so almost like a Monty Python thing. You know, I had also kind of gotten Vietnam and Korea confused. Remember, I knew nothing about Asia. So I thought, oh it would be tropical and warm. And then I’d also been reading the news and I knew that Korea was headed for potentially a civil war and I thought I’d never seen a civil war before, I’d like to see one. Which is a really stupid thing to think. And finally I thought, well how hard could the language be, they’ve got an alphabet. So like I was wrong on half a dozen counts. But I wound up in Korea late June 1987. And they hadn’t really given us much… Well I had about six months ahead of time. I had really kind of dropped all of my other studies and just focused on learning Korean language, which actually was heck of a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I’m generally pretty good at languages, but this one I gotta tell you, twenty years later, it’s still impossible for me. It’s just ridiculous. So, I mean if you grew up speaking Korean, I think it’s terribly unfair. But, I will punish you. In your grade. Yeah, I know it’s sad, but it’s true because I harbor deep resentment against people who can speak Korean very easily.\r\nSo yeah, I had learned a lot about Korea. I basically dropped all of my studies to get up to speed for this year, which was looking more and more to be quite exciting, and in retrospect, it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life. I mean, after all, I’m a professor of Korean folklore now, so that was definitely not in the cards. And you know, after a little bit of orientation and stuff like that, I got to Korea thinking, Oh okay I should know enough Korean to be able to get by. And of course, the stuff I had learned was completely… You know, you hit the ground, and it’s like, Oh my god, I don’t even know if this is the same language. And you know that was pretty jarring actually, to realize that this six months of really intensive language study and history study and doing all of my geeky graduate student stuff where you don’t sleep and you just cram and cram and you know, you read everything- so I knew quite a bit about the history and had a pretty solid foundation in anthropology, and I thought I was getting the language. But that was wrong. And then I’d read a lot about the politics and the political situation and by the time I got there, I knew of course that it was not a tropical wonderland. Which was disappointing actually, to discover that. It was one of those sinking feelings in my stomach when I realized, Oh, this is more like going to New England. Which is where I grew up. And I wasn’t really looking for that type of experience.\r\nBut anyway, I got there and you know those pro-democracy rallies had really taken off. And had galvanized the country to the extent that many people from every walk of life, not just students, were protesting. And when we got there, there were police on every corner… and lots and lots of riot cops. And you know, in different parts of the city a real strong aftertaste of tear gas and I’d been there for like sixteen hours or something like that and the next day, I had to go to the city hall to pick up some kind of thing, I had to pick up some kind of identity card or something. It wasn’t a regular identity card, some kind of credential from the ministry of, we used to call them KAOS, Korean and Overseas Services, that were housed right next to the U.S. Embassy. And I got out my little map and figured, Oh I’ll get of at Seoul City Hall and I’ll walk up Sejŏngno, it should be a cool walk. And I get to the subway station and I couldn’t quite figure out why the subway cars, people had gotten off of them. A lot of people had gotten off of them several stops before city hall. And there were some announcements and there had been some people, but I hadn’t really paid attention and so by the time I get to city hall, I was like, pretty much the only person on the subway car. And I had gotten off at city hall, the station was abandoned. And there were police who were looking at me like, What the hell are you doing here. But I think they just must’ve assumed that I was either some sort of reporter or somehow or other associated with the U.S. Embassy or something like that. They didn’t really hassle me, and I walked upstairs to the plaza and there was a bus fully involved, completely on fire. There was just this wild demonstration raging. There were kids beating on janggu and pungmul instruments off to my left and off to the right, there were hundreds and hundreds of these riot cops. And I was like, Woah, this is going to be one heck of a year. So that was my first introduction to Korea. Really, was that. \r\nS: Where did you stay for the majority of your time in Korea?\r\nT: There was me and this other guy that was on this fellowship, they housed us in An’guktong just for like a week and we thought it was really cool because it was right near Insatong and we thought all of Korea was going to be like that. And much to my dismay, it wasn’t. But it was just fun-\r\nS: What was Insatong, or An’guktong like?\r\nT: Well An’guktong is right next to Insatong. And Insatong is the historical preservation area, so all these little alleyways and all these old kamok houses and these old tea houses. And An’gukdong, there used to be a lot of yŏkwan, like the real yŏkwan, but the old inns. There was a patuk tournament. And you know, people just wandering around in hanbok and stuff like that, but not dressed up or anything, it’s just what they wore. It was like a little taste of old Seoul. It was very interesting, really. The other thing of course, wandering around the streets, it was incredibly hot. Me and my friend, Jim, this is like late 1980s, 1987, we were wandering around in t-shirts and shorts. Of course, a complete no-no. At that time, guys just did not do that. You know, we’re wearing flip flops, t-shirts, and shorts. And entire buses are slowing down, people are just like agape at us because we were clearly not military. They’re just like, What are these people doing. So that was kind of groovy.\r\nThen after that, we had to find our own apartments. So I actually wound up getting an apartment in Oksutong which at the time was, people were like, Oh that’s all the way down by the river. And now, people are like, Oh! Oksutong! That’s on this side of the river. That’s not even down in Apkujŏng. Like getting an apartment in downtown Seoul. At that time, Seoul hadn’t completely become megalopolis that it is now, so it was a little bit out of the way and a neighborhood in transition. It was really cool. Not everything was these giant apartment buildings. There were a lot of like little golmok and a lot of these oraksils and some run down little tile houses. It was really trippy, very cool. And so I studied for the first semester at Yonsei in the morning, I would go to han’guk hakdan and really cranked on learning Korean and managed to do two or three levels in one semester so that was good. And then in the afternoon, I would work at the national museum and Munhwachakwalliguk, cultural properties preservation bureau. And they would take me on these trips to see potential national in’gan munhwachae, national treasures, who were shamans. And I started doing a lot of general survey of shaman shrines in Seoul, but not having a whole lot of luck. The shamans were all really nice to me, but really puzzled. I mean, this white guy showing up with camera and camcorder and they’re like, What, what are you up to? And then I’d explain in my broken Korean. The thing is, most people who are studying Shamanism who were not Korean… if they were Korean, they tended to be kind of anthropologists trying to categorize without doing much analysis… people who were not Korean tended to be women. Guys studying Korean shamanism was kind of freakish. And funny. And then, right around December or so, must’ve been November, I was friends with another person that was on the fellowship and she had wanted to study diving women down in Jeju and she was living in Jeju in a village of diving women. But she had no background in anthropology. None whatsoever. I mean, it was incredible, never even taken a class. She was up in Seoul, I don’t know how I met her. I met her at like some expat party or something like that, bemoaning the fact that she didn’t know what to do. She had this wonderful village and I was like, Oh this is great. I don’t have a wonderful village, but I know exactly what to do so we pooled our resources and I spent a lot of time… I wouldn’t say I moved down to Cheju… but I moved down to Jeju, more or less. But in like two month increments because I still had this appointment at the National Museum that I had to work on. So you know and I helped the National Museum with a lot of translations for the Olympics and stuff like that. \r\nS: So, can you tell me a little bit about how people interacted with you? Did they approach you or did a lot of people just look at you? Or did you actually have interaction with some of the people who were just looking at you?\r\nT: I mean before I spoke reasonable Korean, it was a little bit hard, but people were very, very interested and very friendly. I mean, the first thing they kind of look at you, they kind of size you up, they’re trying to figure out if you’re a missionary or are you military. And you know, I was pretty clearly neither. I was doing a little bit of reporting, photojournalism for various newspapers. So that was kind of an interesting thing. But mostly, I just told people I was there to learn about Korean culture and minsokhak. Minsokhak actually has a nice sort of ring to it in the 1980s. It was sort of like Oh, wow, really. So you know that was never really a problem. The biggest problem was what we called the English leeches. Because at Kyŏngbokkung, which was you know, the National Museum used to be on the grounds of Kyŏngbokkung. And Kyŏngbokkung was a place where a lot of young men and women, mostly young men would go to try to find foreigners to practice their English on. So walking into work, I would often be trailing with three or four people trying to speak English to me. They got kind of annoying since I was there trying to learn Korean. Occasionally, I make a deal and say, Look, I’ll speak English to you for fifteen minutes, you speak Korean to me for fifteen minutes. \r\nThen I had a lot of colleagues at the museum who were nice to me. But late 1980s in Korea, most government employees were pretty poor, so it wasn’t as if we could go partying or something like that. The people who I met doing fieldwork were incredibly friendly, so by the time I was living in Cheju, I was living in somebody’s house. I was just a guest. So I never had a problem. It wasn’t like going to Scandinavia, where if you’re not in the family with people or family friends, it’s very hard to make contact. People were very open, especially once you start speaking in Korean. I think mostly the hesitation came from, Oh I don’t know if this person speaks Korean. And if they know you speak Korean, then they’ll actually assume you speak it way, way better than you actually do.\r\nS: Oh, so were there times when you actually had to pretend like you knew what they were saying when you didn’t?\r\nT: Oh yeah, happens all the time. Yeah, Korean’s kind of funny too because a lot of is a little bit ambiguous because of the way pronouns work and stuff like that. So you’re never a hundred percent sure what people are talking about quite frankly. In particularly, sentence structure and nested sentences. So sometimes, you really have to rely on context.\r\nS: Was there ever a time where you had like a severe miscommunication with someone? \r\nT: Uh, usually just funny ones.\r\nS: Can you share some of them?\r\nT: The funniest one was… I had probably been there maybe about three months. And my conversational Korean was getting to be fine, to the point where I can hold a conversation. It wouldn’t necessarily be correct, but people would have a pretty darn good idea of what I was saying and I could understand a lot of what people were saying back. But I had to get some stuff photo-copied and you know the word for photocopy in Korean is poksa. It’s not “kŏpi.” “Kŏpi” is Korean for coffee. And I, I just figured a photocopy, I didn’t know what the Korean word was but I figured this was one of those things where if I turned it into an English word, I would have no problem. So I walk into one of these little sheds by the side of the road. This is on the way from my subway stop to the museum. And I walk in, and it’s got to be like late October or November so it’s cold outside and I’m happy to be in. And the guy comes up from the back room where he’s got all those photocopy machines and says well, what do you want? And I put my papers up on the counter and said, “Kŏpi jom juseyo.” And he looks at me, and he looks at the papers, and he looks at me and he goes out to the back room and comes back with—and I’m thinking this is really strange, why didn’t he take my papers—and he comes back later with hot coffee. And he’s got one for himself, he’s got one for me, and we sit there we’re drinking the coffee. You know, basically trying all of my stupid conversational things. Oh, it’s really cold outside and blah blah blah, and he’s asking about where I’m from. Oh, I come from America, and I’m studying minsokhak and all of that. And we finish our coffee and he sort of stands there and he’s looking at me and I point back at the papers and say, “Kŏpi jom juseyo.” And he’s looking and like, What, c’mon dude. I just gave you a cup of coffee. And it dawned on me at that point like, Oh. Maybe that’s not the right word. So I used this little dictionary and whipped it out and found the right word and he just cracked up. We both cracked up. That sort of became our running joke. So I would run by there every week or so, come in, and have him give me a cup of coffee. I think I gave him a coffee maker when I left Korea.\r\nS: Oh that’s really funny. So there were a lot of people you met frequently, like multiple times, and built relationships with?\r\nT: Oh yeah, and I was working at a museum and institution. And I had a bunch of expat friends too. Those were really quite fun to hang out with.\r\nS: Do you have a particular friend you made in Korea that you miss or built like a very close relationship with?\r\nT: Yeah, I still have good relationships with the time I spent in Korea. Both among kyopo who were over there and expats. And then also with Koreans who I worked with. Some of the Koreans I worked with at the museum are now much higher up in the museum hierarchy and we bump into each other from time to time and that’s quite funny. And there are a couple of people who I’ve kept in touch with. You know, we were all in college or college-age, I was a little bit out of college, and so a lot of the Koreans, you know, they get careers, they get married, they have kids. And then they disappear. Back then, it wasn’t like there were cell phones or email or Internet to any considerable degree and certainly not in Korea. Even if you wrote letters, there weren’t really good street addresses. So you were never a hundred percent sure if you were staying in contact, and then as soon as somebody gets a cell phone, they kind of disappear. And they all have the last name, Kim Pak Lee. So it’s not that easy to track somebody down once you lose track of them in Korea from that period. But there are a couple of people I still keep in contact with who were at the national museum. And among my kyopo friends, let’s see, I had dinner with one last week. I’m going over to another friend’s house who I was actually doing fieldwork with in Cheju. She lives out here in Palo Alto. So I see her every three weeks. This guy who I shared an apartment with, he’s a North Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. And another guy, who I also shared an apartment with, he used to be the Vice President of the Asia foundation and now he’s working for something called the Plowshares Fund. The journalists who I was doing photography for, I was mostly working for this Finnish news organization, and those two guys I just saw in Scandinavia this past summer. So yeah, I would actually say I’m in very close contact with a lot of people who I met in Korea. There’s another guy who used to be an LA Times reporter now a press officer for one of the county supervisors, who I keep in contact with. And another woman who’s an assistant attorney general here in LA county.\r\nS: Why do you think this trip kind of transformed your interest and even so much so that you would make it a career to teach Korean folklore?\r\nT: I came at the right time of my life. I was twenty three. So definitely, an impressionable point in my life. I had a lot of experience. Eighty-seven Korea was a very different beast, and it was really sort of was still the end year of the Park Chunghee era, which was even closely linked back to the Korean War. I mean we’re talking about a period that really comes to the end in 1987. And so there was a lot going on in the country so a year where you experience a whole lot of stuff can’t help but to leave a pretty indelible impression on you. The other thing was, I had spent so much damn time learning Korean that I certainly wasn’t going to completely abandon it. Although to be honest, I kind of just. When I got back to Cal, my PhD was in Scandinavian and my job when I first got to UCLA was in Scandinavian. It wasn’t until there were these budget cuts in 1994, where they cut my position by half, that I went down to talk to my colleagues in Korean and they knew me, they just didn’t realize I was upstairs. What are you doing here? Oh, I actually work upstairs. And they were like, What? So I started teaching for the program at that point. I must admit, I wasn’t really convinced I was going to be a professor until like tenure. I was thinking about other things. And so, what I discovered was that I had actually over the years become relatively well-versed in Korean folklore, and I certainly know a lot about folklore theory, so it felt like a pretty good fit. There were a lot of interesting things. When I first got to Los Angeles, there had just been the LA uprisings and riots, and so I was very interested in how the whole Korean thing was playing out there. And so I did some fieldwork on that. So you know, I wouldn’t say that I really chose this career path any terribly deliberately, but it kept evolving.\r\nS: I’m kind of really interested in the diving women that you met in Cheju. So what exactly is a diving woman?\r\nT: So a lot of people call them haenyuh or ‘sea women.’ Almost makes them sound like mermaids. They actually prefer to call themselves jamsu which means divers. They call themselves jamsuku, a sort of diving people. And what they do is dive for abalone and for sea cucumber and sea urchin. Cheju is really interesting because the drop off is a volcanic island so you don’t have to go too far and the depth drops off pretty dramatically so that gives you an opportunity to find all sorts of different kinds of shellfish at different levels. And there’s a huge market for abalone in Japan. And they will pay a fortune for abalone. And so these women have been diving and really, most of the coastal villages through Korea, you found these women who would dive for these kinds of shell fish. Sell them to a local cooperative that would mostly sell them to Japan. And so most men in these villages would go on fishing boats and go way out to sea. The women actually would dive close to town. It was very interesting, the village where I was, the women had given up on the men. So they had married at some point but they were also mostly divorced. They had kicked the bums out, they’d said. Yeah, they said they were all drunks. The normal hierarchies of a village didn’t really apply because the women were running a lot of stuff. And they had a lot of money. You could really run a lot of money doing this, but it’s very difficult and you go deaf. So most women stop when they are around fifty-five or so. And usually, they’re deaf by that point. And of course, they don’t want their kids doing it. They would be sending their kids off to university or something like that. So jamsu are kind of a dying breed. There really aren’t that many of them anymore.\r\nS: It kind of reminds me of this Korean movie that I watched a while ago called, inŏ kongju or inŏ ŏmŏni or something like that. Anyway, how did they receive you? Because not only are you not Korean, but also, you’re a man in this predominantly female community. How was that?\r\nT: They just thought it was great. The shaman really liked me because I came from the national museum, so she would bring me around to all of her shaman events and basically say, Oh hey I brought my anthropologist with me. So she really liked the fact that she had this anthropologist who came from the national museum because it gave her huge status. She of course had a great deal of status with the diving women. And I used to do a lot of scuba diving and snorkeling.\r\nS: Previously?\r\nT: Yeah, while I was in college. I thought of this just as a great opportunity to get back into snorkeling shape. So I brought my wetsuit and my gear down. I’d go out diving with them. They just thought that was the funniest damn thing. They had never seen a guy—no guy had ever tried to dive with them. Of course, they kicked my butt. They were amazing. They were in such incredible shape and they dived for like six hours at a time. It was incredible. So they were fun. They taught me a lot of swears. \r\nS: How did people usually spend their time after they were done with work? Were you able to interact with them?\r\nT: Yeah, I mean they’re pretty darn hard. They’re diving. If they’re not diving, they’ve got days off. There’s a pretty elaborate schedule of which days they dive. On days off, they would collect seaweed which they could sell to the seeweed coop for miyŏk and things like that. And a lot of them had little fields where many of them had one or two cows. So they take care of their cows, weed the rice fields, and they had kids and take care of their kids. There weren’t a lot of down time. There were various celebrations throughout the year, all related to calendrical and the shaman would preside at those. They would sit around and play cards, they’d sit around and talk. \r\nS: Did you play those games with them?\r\nT: Oh yeah. And occasionally I would get them to tell me stories. There were a couple of them who were good storytellers.\r\nS: How was your experience with the food there?\r\nT: In Korea in general or in Jeju?\r\nS: Both?\r\nT: In general, it was great.\r\nS: Did you have Korean food before you went to Korea?\r\nT: Oh, once I’d learned that I was going to Korea, since I lived in Berkeley, I looked up Korean restaurants and have Korean food. You know, I liked it. But mostly I thought it was bulkoki and kalbi. I had probably been in Korea three days. And when you’re taking a Korean course, no one tells you the names of the Korean foods so you walk in and the menu was on the wall. It’s all pasted up there, little words. And I looked at these things, and I just ordered the first thing I could sound out. It turned out to be sundubu. And sundubu is great. It was a little bit wrong for a hot summer, but it was okay. And I thought, oh this works. The only thing I didn’t get used to was Korean breakfasts. So I must admit I couldn’t capitulate to eating rice and dried fish and kimchi for breakfast. I had to have corn flakes and milk and coffee. Apart from that, I had great culinary museums. I worked at the a place with cafeteria for the workers. One of the funniest experiences I had was in the cafeteria. The first month or so, they didn’t give me a pass since they said it was no good and I should go to the restaurant. And I said No, I want to eat with you guys. And they said No, no, the food sucks. So they gave me a pass. This was right around December so there was a nasty cold. I had been working on some project and wandered over there with a couple of guys, waiting in line outside and it’s freezing. We come outside and I notice they’re filling up some soup in one of the lines and I thought, I’m going to get that. And two of my buddies go to another line, so I get the soup and it’s a strange looking soup. I got a big bowl of rice and that soup. Turns out Winter of 97 is one of the coldest winters in Korea in decades. Nasty cold. I get my frozen kimchi and am melting it in the soup. And this guy, a good friend of mine, is watching me eat the soup and I’m thinking, this is a really strange soup. It’s got big clumps of something, sort of like purple matzo balls. And I eat it and go up for another bowl of it since it’s warm at least. I’m not enjoying it, but I’m not not enjoying it. I had been hanging out with a lot of folklorists so mind you, their idea of a good time was finding all of the weirdest foods and making me eat it. And I had made sort of a vow to myself that I would pretty much eat anything. Except for the pŏndegi I was okay. I’m halfway through the bowl of soup and he’s like, You like that? And I say, No not really, but I don’t dislike it, but I imagine I’m about to hear why I shouldn’t like it. He’s like, Do you know what it is? You know what, I have no idea and I guarantee you as soon as I find out what it is I’m not going to like it. Yeah, you’re not going to like it. That’s coagulated blood. So that was the end of that. It was just the pŏndegi. I had been in Korea for about two weeks and I had met some of the other people on different fellowships. This woman was on a Fulbright and we were on the streets and everyone had a cone of pŏndegi. And I didn’t know what they were. I just thought Wow, that smells bad but everyone’s eating these, I should give it a try. And they’re crunchy and sort of weird tasting, but they don’t taste bad. They just kind of smelled gross. Korean popcorn or I had no idea what this was. And I’m walking along, and this woman I had just met sees me and says, Oh hey Tim. She looks at me and says, Woah, what are you  eating? And she goes, Ugh! Pŏndegi? You like that? I was like, Uh, I don’t know? Do you know what it is? I have no idea what this is. So that was another one of those things that was like.. Ugh.\r\nS: So a lot of these things, you just had to try these things out without knowing what they were?\r\nT: Well, if everyone else was eating them, how bad could they be? \r\nS: Did people ever approach about the way that you dressed? Because I’m sure that they may have wondered why you dressed differently than them?\r\nT: Not really. About three months in, all of my clothes had been bought in Korea. I didn’t have a whole lot of clothes to begin with. Couple of pants and some shirts and a jacket. So, I would say the only thing I got were from my Korean colleagues who were men. They’d say, You’re so lucky because no one expects you to wear a suit, coat, and tie to work everyday. And I wouldn’t. I just refused, and wouldn’t do it. \r\nS: And you weren’t expected to? \r\nT: I’m sure I was expected to, but I didn’t. And nobody really knew what to say to me. And why should you care? That was the only real thing. Pretty much, all my clothes were bought in Korea at that time. You’d get little kids running around behind you saying Hello Mister Monkey.\r\nS: In English?\r\nT: Yeah, in English. Or, Hello Joe. They had that. Occasionally, as my Korean got better, I’d be on the subway and hear people whispering about me. There was this one guy, he was being a real bastard and complaining to his friend about how foreigners are not only ugly and smell badly, but shouldn’t be allowed in the country. And I sort of leaned over and said, Hey, can I borrow your sports section of the Chosŏn ilbo? And it was horrible, because he had lost so much face. You really shouldn’t do that kind of thing, but he was being such an ass. I figured, he deserved a little humiliation.\r\nS: How long did you stay in Korea?\r\nT: That first time, I was there for fifteen months.\r\nS: And then you’d gone plenty of times since then?\r\nT: And then two months later, I went for about four months to collect fairytales.\r\nS: And how did you collect these fairytales? Where did you go and who did you have to meet?\r\nT: I asked everybody I met. It was also a bad excuse to see a lot of different parts of Korea I hadn’t seen. I figured I would hitchhike, but it’s really hard to hitchhike in Korea. There’s no real tradition for hitchhiking. So I’d be out in the middle of nowhere and I’d have a sign that says some village or something and people would stop for me. Frequently. And they would take me to the closest bus station. And I didn’t want a bus. I would also go to the noinjang where the old people were, and I’d just introduce myself and they were like, What the heck. And I’d say I was here to hear some old stories and fairytales, yennal iyaki, and they would laugh and they would tell me stories. And I’d record them. I had a couple of colleagues who were teaching folklore and got me in touch with some of their students and we would all go out and do fieldwork together. I just kicked around. The funeral in Jindo, I had just gotten there and had been there four or five days, staying where I could. I would go meet people and say I didn’t really have a place to stay. And people would invite me back and let me stay at their place. People were really friendly. Puzzled, but friendly. I don’t think it would be very likely to happen now. It was pretty long time ago. That was around 89, 90… I went back in 92 to see rituals back in Jeju. And in 94, I helped a friend make a documentary about that for National Geographic. That village, I went back to, but by then it was already changing. I went back a whole bunch of times for talks and stuff like that. I was back to make the punk rock documentary in 99. Over the past ten years, since I have a family, I’ve gone back a lot less. I went back this past summer to make a follow up to the punk rock documentary. But it’s a completely different place. Going to Korea now is like going to Los Angeles, everybody’s Korean. \r\nS: Does your family share the same kind of interest in Korea as you do?\r\nT: Absolutely not. No. I think they might like some Korean food but not really and have almost no interest in going there. Almost all of my colleagues in Korean studies, if they’re not Korean, married a Korean. I didn’t do that. I didn’t get the memo. Everyone assumes I’m married to a Korean. It would make my life a whole lot easier. There would be places to stay in Korea, somebody to help me with translations. \r\nS: You said people were friendly and were hospitable and would let you stay in their houses. But you don’t think that would happen so much anymore now. Why do you think that is?\r\nT: Well, I also meant in the countryside. In the cities, people are very friendly and stuff like that. They’re just living in much small spaces. Frankly, I haven’t tried since I have places to stay. Out in the countryside, it’s changed a lot. It’s a lot less populated and up to a lot of elderly people taking care of their children’s children. And a lot of bachelor farmers. So it’s not necessarily happy and communal as it used to be.\r\nS: Did you have any instances when you were trying to buy stuff, did you have to learn about the bargaining culture?\r\nT: Oh yeah. The interesting thing is that the bargaining culture has really changed. A lot of it has gone away. You used to bargain for everything. Now, a lot of places, it’s the final price. You can’t go to the Lotte department store and bargain for something. A lot of places like Namdaemun hasn’t been as big as it used to be. There were times when the price you paid were not legitimate prices. I don’t really like to bargain. So it turns out, my strategy is a remarkably bargaining strategy. Because if the price was too high, you just leave. And they’re like, Woah, wait a second. And they’d cut the price. And eventually I’m sure I would pay too much, but I would get something at a price I was comfortable paying. But it’s tiring, I didn’t have the time and energy to bargain. \r\nI found it very hard to go grocery shopping back in the 80s. Because there were no markets or grocery stores we think of them. There were little kiosks and you had to go to different places to buy different things. You had to have a lot of time to buy a lot of things.

She used to teach Korean literature in a junior high when younger, and my father was a businessman working for a company. When I was young, my mother was forced by my father’s parents to quit work, so that she could stay home and take care of me and my brother. She did end up leaving work, and this was a result of the male chauvinism prevalent in Korea at the time. Times have changed since then. The female status in Korea has improved greatly the past 100 years, and this social change has also affected the practice of traditional culture. The changes did not take place overnight. Even with the busy schedule, the females in Korea have kept the traditional Korean customs that have been handed down from generation to generation. They believe that carrying out these traditional ceremonies is crucial in expressing respect for the elders and securing good fortune for the generations to come. Most of the preparation for these traditional holidays and customs fall on the female. However, when the female also holds a job like her male counterpart, thing are different. Traditionally the female would have to prepare for the traditional event even after a long day at work, and this has led to a lot of stress and discontent on the female’s part. Due to which, a new business was introduced in Korea a few years back – a catering company that would prepare the food needed for the traditional ceremonies. This made it very convenient for busy families to get together and still hold the traditional events without the females of the family having to arduously prepare the food. There are negative opinions to this as well, saying that we are no longer spending time and putting in the effort to prepare food for our ancestors, but for families with a busy schedule this made it possible to still meet the formalities of traditional customs. Many more changes followed. There are now temples that hold traditional ceremonies on families’ behalf. My family has also partially embraced these more convenient ways of holding on to traditional customs. Korean tradition requires that a ceremony be held annually on the date that an ancestor passes away. If you are the eldest in the family (the eldest is usually tasked with holding the traditional ceremonies), you could be holding more than 30 ceremonies a year. My mother has changed these customs drastically, however, to suit her busy lifestyle. The new plan was for the entire family to get together on the two big Korean holidays of the year, but simplify the ceremony for the ancestors by outsourcing the ceremonies to temples. The ceremony would get held on a certain date, and the family representative and any other family members that are available would go to the temple to take part in the ceremony. Although the response was negative at first, the family is now more supportive of the idea. To start, the traditional ceremonies and customs are no longer associated with a lot of work for females. Also, the relationship between the attendees and non-attendees has improved, since there is no longer the pressure to attend. The female members of the families are no longer stressed during holidays. My mother thinks these changes are reflective of the flow of the times. She believes that the change started in the 1970s when we started simplifying overly complicated and arduous customs. And the flow is now resulting in the changes we see today. \r\n\r\n','???

Using this new celebration of love as the context, do you think Koreans people are getting more Korean, or westernized?\r\nA:Um…I think both ways..the one example is Velentine’s day and another one is Pepero day.\r\n\r\n7.       Do you think a couple would feel more “in love” by celebrating the Valentine’s Day or this?\r\nA:Velentine’s day.\r\n\r\n8.   Do you think in general Koreans have changed the way they view the concept of “love” compared to, say, ten years ago?\r\nA:Yeah I guess..yeah..it changed a lot.I think people are more open minded than the past.\r\n\r\n9.

I also prepped her to make sure she would not feel stiff and awkward.\r\n\r\n•	First exposure to Korean dance—no prior background experience, but when UCLA had their Korean Culture Night (KCN), she first auditioned for cast. She did not make it, but she still wanted to be a part of KCN, so she auditioned for Korean traditional dance. However, she did not know anything about it; her only background was when she saw the traditional dance performance in KCN her first year and in television shows.\r\no	She knew KCN had a traditional dance segment and she and her friends decided together to audition for traditional dance if cast did not work out.\r\no	She heard traditional dance auditions were easier than modern dance.\r\n•	Preparation for KCN—auditions in winter quarter; 1-1½ hours of practice once a week; intensive retreat in spring break; all in all, roughly 3 months of preparation.\r\n•	She thought traditional dance would be pretty and graceful and easy. However, while she was learning it, she realized there were much more technicalities, so it was harder than she expected.\r\no	Every single movement, at every single beat, you have to make your flicks strong, your movements noticeable, but graceful at the same time.\r\n•	Grace had no prior dance experience before KCN.\r\n•	The performance time in KCN was so short, but because of that, they worked under an easier environment. During the retreat, they would do the routine once then take a short break and then do the routine once more and then go take a nap. (Laughs.) It was really chill.\r\no	Once the girls learned the routine, the rest was about refining it.\r\n•	Because the team was so small, she got to know everyone after the retreat, which made the experience more fun as well.\r\n•	Being on stage for her was exhilarating. \r\no	But the actual performance was so short, so she barely remembers it. It was all adrenaline and muscle memory.\r\no	For her, the team and the practices were more memorable for her.\r\n•	Composition of the team was all Korean-Americans, many with little to no dance experience. Because she is Korean American and she does not really have fob friends, she does not know how close she would have been able to get close if the team was more fob then Korean-American.\r\n•	Because her heritage is Korean, she felt that it was really cool that she was doing something innately Korean. Because there are no Korean-American traditions and she does not do American traditions with her family, she just felt that Korean traditional dance was fun.\r\n•	She felt like she was doing something different, a Korean thing to do. But because the team was all Korean-American, it was more of a Korean-American thing rather than a Korean thing. KCN overall is more of a Korean-American experience.\r\n•	Korean traditional dance movements—very elegant and graceful, she thinks. The movements are very simple, but something is really pretty about it. The way the Korean traditional dancers dress, their hair, their makeup is very flashy in womanly way. It really emphasizes a woman’s femininity.\r\n•	She performed a crown flower dance last year. (She did not remember the name.) This year, for KCN, she is using fans.\r\n•	Costumes—last year, the costumes were very pretty. She really liked the costumes for last year. The dresses were gold and shimmery and wore crowns on their head. She really felt like she was in a costume and was amazed that people actually wore them as their wardrobe.\r\no	She seemed very disappointed with this year’s costumes. The hanboks are property of UCLA and are clearly worn and used. There are visible stains as well.\r\n•	The hardest part of this year’s dance for KCN is working with the fan. She said she sucks at the fans and keeps dropping them. When asked for elaboration, she stated that the fans have to be opened in a certain way that they are pretty and that they are opened all the way. She has to adjust her hand so that the fan can show. But when you are constantly moving around, the fans get stuck or in your way. It is hard for her because she has no background experience, so she tries to practice extra.\r\n•	In regards to this year’s team for KCN, she stated that the other girls seem to have more background dance experience, with very few girls that have no prior experience.\r\no	Also, most of the girls on the team do know each other, so it is kind of clique-ish, but it is too early to determine the team dynamics.\r\n•	The fan dance (부채춤) is so new to her that she feels like she is learning a completely new dance. Her movements should be similar to what she learned last year, but because the difference between a sleeve and a fan is so big, she feels like she is learning from scratch again. \r\no	For her, the fan is so heavy and big, while the sleeves were light.\r\n•	Her favorite part of the KCN experience last year was her team. Because they were “suffering” together, it made the experience more fun. And the work was difficult, but it was not overwhelming, so it allowed them to have fun at the same time. Also, there was the sense of accomplishment from being a part of a large production like KCN. \r\n•	During practices, though, you are just part of Korean traditional dance because you do not really see anyone else.\r\n•	Her parents did not really have much of a reaction to her performance because they are not really a big part of her school life. \r\n•	Her Korean proficiency level is fairly decent; she can understand it and speaks it in front of her parents, but she is very conscious about her accent so she does not speak in front of anyone else.\r\n•	Speaking about one of the “assignments” for last year’s KCN traditional dance practice—she had to borrow a friend’s laptop to record her practice and it was really awkward because her friend was just watching her. \r\no	Also, she was a little surprised that she had to practice during finals week.\r\n•	Expectations for this year’s KCN—overall, she is having a fun time because most of her friends made the team this year, so she is looking forward to the retreat. She feels as though this production will be another good one. \r\n•	It was cool how a lot of girls actually did do Korean traditional dance when they were younger and now they are choosing to do it again in college. Although they are not necessarily learning about the history of it, just the fact that they are doing it ties the girls back to their Korean roots.\r\no	When she dances, she feels that what she is doing is very Korean. Her surroundings may not be Korean, but just the fact that all the girls are Korean unites them.\r\no	The dance itself is something you would not see in Western society. It is very Oriental—the movement, the style, the music, the costumes, and the overall performance are just very Asian. \r\no	She felt that it was very fitting of them to do Korean traditional dance just because they are Korean.\r\n•	Korean traditional dance, to her, is something that is not American and it is cool because it is something she sees on television but she is actually doing it. And also, it is special she knows it is something that she would never do and she will not do. The experience evokes a sort of Korean pride in her. \r\no	The Korean traditional dance is very different from how she acts because she acts more Korean American, although she is Korean.\r\n•	Watching traditional Korean dance is very pretty and graceful, but it is not exciting. The movements all look the same and the music sounds the same, so it is more exciting to perform it than to watch it.\r\n','Grace.mp3','audio/mp3',38085693,1872001),(197,51,-1,163,'The Binge-Drinking Culture of Korea','Audio','I asked Ishani whether she thinks an alcohol drinking culture exist in American collge and if there is a hierarchy to the people within this drinking culture.

Due to time constraints, we tried to find a quiet, separate space in the Student Activities Center where I had met up with Suyoung. Overall, it was fairly quiet with a few people walking by occasionally. I also tried to maintain a comfortable atmosphere, but still keep it focused.\r\n\r\n•	Difference between Korean dance and other dances—Teachers told her that Korean dance is done naturally, so the muscles used are the ones you use naturally. Whereas for something like ballet, you do not use the muscles you use regularly, so you have to force things that you do not really do. For example, stepping in Korean dance is basically walking with a little more bending. That is why her teachers taught that you have to look natural when doing Korean dance.\r\n•	Most Korean dance kids do not switch their majors between middle school and high school because you have been trained to do a certain type of dance for many years so it is difficult to change. The muscles that you use for Korean dance and for other dances are different and to start a new major in high school is considered late. Switching majors in middle school was not allowed.\r\no	Suyoung knew a couple people who did switch. When asked why, she was not sure, but she figured it may have been a physical difference. She said how for ballet there was a certain preferred height requirement, but in modern dance height was not a problem.\r\n•	Ballet had the strictest visual grading scale because your entire line shows, but in Korean dance, you wear hanboks and full dresses. But the grading scale was not noticeably different. In the dance exams held by the school, even the Korean dance students had to perform in tights and leotards.\r\no	In third year, students may be asked to wear hanbok during exams.\r\n•	The exams consisted about 5-6 different dances with 5-6 teachers plus the department head of the school presiding. Sometimes she would have to dance individually or in groups of 3-4. \r\no	The department head taught the upperclassmen occasionally, but there were other teachers, so she did not teach often.\r\no	Teachers hired by the school were usually in charge of teaching basics; teachers hired by the department from dance companies taught the special classes, which included instruments as well as dance.\r\no	Learned fan dance as well as sword dance from these special teachers.\r\no	At first, she would learn the basics from the teachers hired by the school, but as she got older she would learn from these guest teachers because the school encouraged the learning of different styles of dances.\r\no	The teachers hired by the school were mostly alumni, so all of them had a similar dancing style.\r\n•	Experience with learning the sword dance—you do not get cut by the props, but you do get bruises because you have to land them on your arm. \r\no	Sometimes, it looked like you got beaten up. When she and her fellow students take the subway, people would stare. It was summer, so she and her fellow students would wear short sleeves, exposing the bruises.\r\no	Said the sword dance was one of her favorite dances because the teacher was like an angel when she danced. She was one of the top dancers at a national company. She and her fellow students would look at her and wonder when they were going to be like her.\r\no	She really enjoyed learning this dance. This was one of the first dances she did with props. \r\n•	The school wanted the students to have a similar style. And as you get older, you can develop your own style. During her 3rd year of middle school, she had to take a creativity class, in which the teacher would play music and the students simply had to dance to it. The music was not always traditional music.\r\n•	Another one of her favorite dances was a creative dance made by one of her teachers. It was called 봉숭아 dance. It was the story of a little girl enjoying her freedom and the rest of the dancers are flowers. Then in the next scene, they were scarecrows scaring the lead. The lead was usually an upperclassman, while the underclassmen were all background. Suyoung got to perform this particular dance a lot.\r\n•	Even in middle school, there were a couple of people who went abroad to study. Some places included France and Russia. These students would get scouted or if they win competitions, offers would be made to study at the foreign school.\r\no	Most of her ballet friends are abroad right now.\r\n•	In high school, majors become broader and since you learned all the basics in middle school, you get to do what you want to do.\r\n•	For performers, stage experience is really important.\r\no	Because she attended a performing arts school, she was allowed to go to the performances that occurred in the middle of the day. She liked performances because she got to miss school with permission.\r\n•	When she came to the US, the dance studio did not really say anything about her dance style. She just memorized the routines and performed with them.\r\n•	Different styles in Korean dance—some people prefer soft movements; sometimes sharp movements are wanted. But more than individual style, each dance has its own style.\r\n•	In Korea, her Korean dance experience was more about learning the basics. In America, her Korean dance experience was more performing.\r\no	She performed with a student group relatively similar to her in age. She would perform at Korean festivals and any Korean-related things.\r\no	Her dance studio founder has been in America for 30 years and she is well-known. When she first opened, she performed at Olympics.\r\no	The name of the dance studio is 김우라 Dance Studio in Koreatown.\r\no	Suyoung started performing with the students after 1 month. She also did not have to pay the tuition.\r\no	She met the teacher through connections with her middle school and her relatives.\r\no	She never imagined she would continue Korean dance when she moved to America—considers herself lucky.\r\n•	Suyoung brought all her old hanboks from Korea, but never got the opportunity to wear them.\r\n•	In America, she would go to the studio to practice once a week during the school year and every day during the summer.\r\no	In the beginning of each class, everyone would go over the basics, and then people would split up and practice their own dances.\r\no	In America, her practices was more about learning the routine; in Korea, her dance practices were a class setting.\r\n•	Performing in America—audience wise was similar because it was Korean-related events, so it was mostly Korean people; but stage-wise, in Korea, performances would be in real theaters or stages, but in America, most of the time, the stage was a built-up stage rather than a theater.\r\no	Sometimes, she would have to dance on the regular ground, so her dance shoes would get messed up after a few performances, and the shoes were expensive to replace since they had to be bought from Korea. So she used to have separate performance shoes and practice shoes.\r\n•	Suyoung did not have much of a culture shock because she lived in Koreatown when she moved to America.','suyoungII.mp3','audio/mp3',31665004,1872862),(199,51,-1,164,'The Binge-Drinking Culture of Korea','Audio','I asked Armando, who is underage, what he thinks of the drinking culture in U.S. colleges and whether there is a hierarchy that forces him to drink.

Below are a few question to assist in my fieldwork for my Korean folklore class. Please be thorough with the answers and send them back soon if possible, the sooner the better ( since I have been lagging on this project). If completed I can get you a meal or something like that for helping me. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n1.	Please tell me about your church, including the geography, staff, members, service, food, tradition, etc. This question is very open ended and can include as much information as you want.\r\nSt. Gregory Nazianzen – three different communities and three masses: (English) Filipino community, (Spanish) Hispanic community, and (korean) Korean community. However, for the English masses, there’s one catered to the youth group (Korean Americans). In that particular mass, it is the most diverse: Caucasians, African Americans, and Filipinos. \r\n\r\nOther than the few times I go to 7 AM Korean mass with my parents, I usually go to the English mass (catering to the youth group).\r\n\r\nPriests:\r\nPast: originally had the “English” priest (white) as the head – with Columban Fathers (mostly Irish priests who were fluent in Korean also) presiding both Korean and English masses. Then there was also a Korean priest and a Hispanic priest.\r\nNow: a bilingual (English-Korean) Korean priest is the head. An English-speaking priest (presumably “Caucasian”), Korean priest and a Hispanic priest\r\n\r\n2.	What are your typical plans after church service? Be specific, your plans could extend to the evening or night. \r\n\r\nWhen I was in youth group in high school, after Sunday school and then mass, I would usually have lunch (ktown, food courts at the grove/Beverly center, or restaurants) with the counselors (they were only 4-8 years older than me). My older sister is friends with them, so I would usually tag along. We usually would watch the guys play basketball or hang out (shop, cook, bake, etc). On some weekends, we would go out for dinner too. Outside of church, we were friends, which I much appreciated.\r\n\r\n3.	Are you involved in any other non-church related social outings that are after church? \r\n\r\nOccasional basketball? Hanging out after? (like during Christmas time, superbowl, easter, summer, or what not → we would hang out at one of the houses/apts) we would have bbqs.\r\n\r\n4.	Do you notice any weekly patterns or trends (among yourself or your friends) that emerge from church attendance? \r\n\r\nWe would always hang out after church. The same group of people would hang out together (occasionally some people joined us). It kind of became a tradition? (my Sundays used to go from 9:30-5/6pm). It kind of took over my whole Sunday\r\n\r\n5.	Are there any patterns or trends that grew out of old post church traditions? \r\nNot sure, but I do know that the Korean community would usually give out coffee and bread (rice cakes) to everyone after the mass. Similar to that, we would all go out for lunch and catch up after mass. (is this what you’re asking??)\r\n6.	Finally, is there anything else that wasn\'t stated and you would like to write about?\r\nNow that I am away from home, I have stopped coming to this church specifically. However, I feel the traditions somewhat continues. At school, I would just go to UCC with friends and grab lunch after). At home, I would go to St. Brendan (the richer, white-majority church closer to my house) with my sister and our friends. We then would go for lunch after.\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry D.

What did he look for in a prospective marriage. What he looked in a wife is compatibility, if she can make him laugh, trust, and the later ( a few minutes into the conversation) he said if he could go back and add love as the most important thing he looks for in a wife. Out of all of my interviewees he was the first one to mention the word \"love\". I\'m not sure if that the other thought love was unnecessary to mention cause it was assumed or that they didn\'t really think about love. \r\n\r\nWhat his parents want is the same as him. He says his parents trust in his decision.\r\n\r\nHe has never heard of matchmaking before.\r\n\r\nHis religion is Christianity and he goes to church quite often.\r\n\r\nHe is a 2nd generation. He mention that he had siblings that went to Korean school to learn Korean. His parents never sent him to one. One of his regrets is not learning Korean earlier on. Although he thinks his Korean is quite proficient now. He says this regret is something he doesn\'t want his children to regret and that he would want to teach them Korean.\r\n\r\nHis wedding would be a more Western wedding. (Like everyone one I asked.) I had asked if he would have Korean elements in it. He said he might keep the duck. (He\'s the 2nd person I asked that thought the goose was a duck.)\r\n\r\nHe doesn\'t care about size of wedding. And if he marries a non-Korean he would want to teach her Korean. He said he doesn\'t care about race. And that \"He believe that if God set him up with someone who\'s different racially or religiously it was his duty to show her Christianity\". (Out of all the people I interviewed he was the most religious. Other mention not such a strong affiliation or no affiliation at all.) He said it would be \"nice\" to marry a Christian.\r\n\r\nInstead of traditional patriarchal family. He is more closer to his mother\'s side of the family. His father\'s side is all in Korea. While most of his mother\'s family is in the states. \r\n\r\nI asked him to tell me an account of his parents and how did they get married. He said his grandma introduced them together and that they were family friends.\r\n\r\nI tried to ask if there was some type of racial hierarchy. Because I know that some Korean still dislike Japanese. For example, when I told Ruth in class one person I interviewed talked about interracial marriage and his cousin married a Japanese. She gasped and asked why? She said something along the lines of culturally Korean don\'t like Japanese.\r\n\r\nHe said there was no racial hierarchy and that his sister is dating a Mexican or Hispanic looking guy. He says that he grandma is quite fond of him.\r\n\r\nHis family in the states has stopped ancestor worship/veneration and that his family in Korea still has some aspects of veneration. \r\n\r\nAlthough, his family is not very patilineal due to the fact his father side still resides in Korea. He mention he would like to be patrilineal. He said he was raised up as a typical Korean male hierarchy. The female as a housewife and the husband as the bread winner. He said if he was financially stable in the future, he would like to have his wife as a housewife so that she could raise the kids more properly.\r\n\r\nHis ideal age of marriage is late 20\'s around 28-29. He said he\'ll consider himself too old to be a bachelor around 32.\r\n\r\nHe also expressed the want to travel before having kids or settling down.','Nick 1.1.m4a','audio/x-m4a',3923337,1850531),(230,56,243,189,'Fieldwork ','Fieldnotes','Sarah\'s responses to my questions. \r\n\r\n1. What kind of neighborhood did you grow up in (Suburban or urban) and what city? What were the ethnic demographics of your middle school and high school? Glendale, CA – Urban. \r\nHigh school approximately:\r\n40% Armenian \r\n30%Hispanic\r\n20% Asian (About 50% Pilipino)\r\n10% White/Black\r\n\r\n2. Ethnically, what kind of friends did you hang out with while you were growing up? Present day? \r\nArmenian, Asian, White. What you need to understand is that the lines that distinguish race were not so detailed. You were Asian, Armenia, Mexican, White, or Black. There weren’t enough Asians to distinguish between Korean, Chinese, or Japanese. \r\n\r\n3. Do both of your parents work? \r\nYes\r\n\r\n4. Did your parents teach you any Korean traditions/customs/language while you were growing up?  (chuseok, new years)\r\nHell yes. And they ensured that I grew up around Koreans, learned the language (Korean School for 7 years), and traditions. And I fully grasp and am proud of my heritage.\r\n\r\n5. Did you parents reinforce your Korean identity? If not, why do you think they didn’t? \r\nYes. My parents’ loyalties even after having immigrated 30 years ago and having taken on America/Canadian citizenship, I believe are to the country of Korea. And they are very concerned about the Korean community here and in Korea. I grew up listening to Radio Korea (used to be AM 1230 now is AM 1540) because that was all they would listen to in the car and it would be on all day in the kitchen. I didn’t listen to American news or watch CNN. All the news I heard was about whatever political issues were going on in Korea.\r\n\r\n6: As a Korean American, do you favor your American side or your Korean side? Why? This question is important and if you can please write in a detailed response. \r\nIts complicated. \r\nMy “Korean side”? Kimchi runs in my veins. I love it and I love Korean food. Dorm food was so tasteless after growing up with Maeuntang, kimchi jjigae, etc. I speak Korean and there is a certain familiarity whenever I speak it and am around Korean speaking people. I grew up going to the LA Korean Festival every year. I’m fascinated by being Korean. I’m Korean-American. I look Asian and if I go to the woodlands in Virginia where everyone is white, without a doubt I stand out. But I’m not going around worrying that I look different. \r\nMy “American Side”\r\nAgain, I’m Korean-American. Born in the USA. Appreciate everything about this country. An American is not white even though that’s the image that comes to mind. \r\nI guess it’s a matter of loyalty. Even though I grasp my Korean heritage, my political loyalty for example, lies in my country of citizenship. I am privileged to have been born and raised here and that fully is reason to be loyal to the country that is good to me.\r\n\r\n7. How often were you exposed to Korean culture while growing up? \r\nFunny I guess. I was more exposed to Korean culture than any other growing up. \r\nI think the question better asked may be how I was exposed to “America” while growing up? My parents and I love roadtrips. We’ve spent months driving through all the Western States (As far east as Colorado, Wyoming, as far south as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and as far north as the border with Canada). We have been to the south including Mississippi and Louisiana. I have had the opportunity to see America and interact with the people outside of Los Angeles. And I learned early on that Los Angeles is not a microcosm for most of the USA. Especially when I entered college, I spent time in Quantico, VA (About 50 miles south of DC) with people from all over the United States including Montana, Idaho, Alaska, and Maine. \r\n\r\n8. How has growing up in Koreatown reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\nRestaurants. Do I have to say any more? Korean markets make possible easy access to ingredients to make Korean food. Annual Korean Festival? Yes please!\r\n\r\n9. Has going to church reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\nActually, it reinforced my identity as American. When I’m surrounded by Koreans, especially the older generations at church, I realize that I am more American.\r\n\r\nP.S. Takes this as you will. I love country music. \r\nSome KPop is awesome too (Big Bang) but I don’t actively go searching for their new albums. If I happen to hear it and like it, I’ll download it.\r\n','','',0,0),(231,13,83,150,'Soojin- International Marriage','Audio','Audio File URL (Part 1 & 2):\r\nhttp://www.box.com/s/02d5848b0c35dbef6c37\r\nhttp://www.box.com/s/6e3ffc4a8b1b79b0facc\r\n\r\nSoojin is a 33 years old Korean woman who graduated from a university in Seoul and came to the U.S about 5 years ago. She finished community college last year and started doing OPT, Optional Practical Training period before she\'ll go to graduate school here next year.\r\nSoojin and her boyfriend, Robert, met through Blind meeting in Itaewon being introduced by their own friends about 7 years ago. Even though she always dreamed of coming to America, she doesn\'t have any specific plan and just slightly wanted to have an English teacher at that time. After about 6 months, they started dating.\r\n\r\nShe thinks there are three types of what Korean people think about international marriages. First one is an old-fashioned and conservative idea mostly of old generations; they are against their children have international marriages. Second one is that the international marriages are accepted by both older and younger generations. Third one is not to even be interested in international marriages by mostly younger generations today. \r\n\r\nWhen she told her parents that she has been going out with a white guy for a while, although her father reacted okay, her mother got a little upset. Her mother had no idea of her daughter dating with a non-Korean man and she said dating is ok but not marrying to him. Despite of her mother\'s disagreement though, she still believes she can convince her by showing that Soojin and Robert are very bot happy, successful, and supporting each other.\r\nShe believes in fate; she believes herself to meet a proper person to date with to encourage her better, and to support her in a right way while she despises those guys who have old-fashioned idea such as that women have to stay at home and do only housework. She doesn\'t practice any religion even though she and Robert both prefer Buddhism \'neutral\' idea. She sounded very neutral of her philosophy, future, and marriage because she wants to believe what she believes rather than the forms of races or ethnics.','','',0,0),(232,13,84,151,'Sun- International Marriage','Audio','Audio File URL: http://www.box.com/s/a297961ebba729e1abe2\r\n\r\nSun, a 23 years old UCLA student, was born in Seoul and came to the U.S about 6 years ago as the last generation of her family to immigrate from Korea; all her family and relatives have been living in the U.S for longer time. Even though she has never dated with a non-Korean man, she told me a few stories of her friends and cousins.\r\n\r\nShe told me her Korean girlfriend who dates with a non-Korean guy would often have problems with language. One Korean woman and a white guy, while they are together, they sometimes spend pretty separately an American man watching American shows  while the Korean woman is doing something different.\r\n\r\nHer image of what people think of international marriages in Korea is simply divided by two generations; old and new. There was very rare opportunity for Korean people to get married to non-Korean person before. It was more of surprising than looking bad to get married to a foreigner. Today, it is considered normal to have international marriages though some older generations still would get conservative. One of reasons is that because of language mostly, parents would be afraid not be able to communicate or share their mutual culture with a foreigner son in a law. She also argued about the points of view by American parents versus Korean parents.\r\n\r\nHer parents wouldn\'t care what kind of ethnicity or race of a person she will get married to, she talked confidently. She said she knows that they trust her. The reason of her confidence saying that might come from her much time of spending together with her family. Her father is a priest of the church and Sun is the 5th generation as Christian here in the U.S within her family lineage. She sounded she loves to go to the church and do practice with her family members.\r\n\r\nShe says that there are two kinds of Korean students in the U.S; international students from Korea and American who were born, grown up, and live in America.

They married through meeting at church in the U.S.\r\nEven though her ideal about marriage is open to anyone, because her parents prefer her to marry a Korean man, she would prefer a Korean man as well, she quite uncertainly replied.\r\n\r\nBut in fact, past four marriages within her family, their partners were all non-Korean. She says \"in talk, the parents say \'we want you to get married with Korean\' but for the sake of children\'s\' happiness, they don\'t actually mind as much as they sound like.\" She continues \"It also might be related to the period. Now is 2012, and parents know that whatever they say doesn\'t go anywhere… Sorry parents (laugh).\"\r\nShe told me of her friend who is seeing a pure Korean man, too. \"My friend is dating with a fob (which is the term I didn\'t know until then), but you can tell with his accents that he is a fob. She is from No Cal and I guess she is white washed, so I totally didn\'t think they would get together. Her boyfriend is a couple of years older. What I noticed was when we Korean all hang out, he doesn\'t speak Korean to us. He speaks English with a heavy accent to us. For me, I wouldn\'t go out with a fob.\"\r\nIt is hard for her to understand her parents/ grand-parents generation have to be so against international marriages. Especially in America, it\'s more like a salad bowl rather than a melting pot. When you come to think the future generation, we will constantly be immigrating. I understand that the concern about their loss of culture and preservations but at the same time I think they will be more accepting it. \r\nAt this age, younger generations like them are not concerning about the particularity of international marriages or the point to discuss about it. \"I\'m not a romantist, but there is a mutual connection and something is going to click when it comes down to you.\" What she particularly cares is the things her parents tell her. For her, since her parents told that they prefer Korean people to marry, for marriage, she now thinks she will particularly prefer a Korean guy except for the relationships she is going to have before that.','120308_Ann.MP3','audio/mp3',16340867,1871619),(234,13,89,154,'Mimi- International Marriage','Audio','Audio File URL: http://www.box.com/s/d36a0a2ac394a1787145\r\n\r\nMimi is a 39 years old Korean woman who came to the U.S in 1994 for the first visit. She then acquired a Green card in 2001, a permanent residence of the U.S, in 2001 and a citizenship after. (She was fully living in Korea until the age of 27.) She became an immigrant. Before she became a fulltime student at UCLA, she used to work as a teacher at a Korean church center and also back in Korea.\r\nShe has been dating with a Korean guy for 4 years now. They met through a church activity called \"missionary tree\" at a Christian church she used to go (now that she\'s a full time student she is too busy to go). Her boyfriend came from Korean and practices Korean traditions, practice and culture rather than an American way. He doesn\'t speak English very well but he is a successful business man here in L.A.\r\nHer ex-boyfriend, on the other hand, was a Korean American guy who was 1.5 generation and is much more adapted to a mainstream American society, culture and style. She prefers her current boyfriend because she can have an easy communication with the same value and language of Korea. He could act in a convenient or selfish way between Korean and American ways; he wanted her to be independent even though he yet has a Confucian mind and idea to some extent. He was nice and had more manners for her at the beginning. Yet her Korean American ex-boyfriend considered himself as Korean ethnic more than American. The reason of that she thinks is because of the way his parents educated him; they constantly told him \"You are Korean.\" Therefore she believes that parents education like his case directly relates to build who they are rather than their environment and the country or region where they were grown up.\r\nAccording to her, during 1960 to 1970s, living near army and selling their body for armies, Korean wives of foreigners were considered as prostitutes which was regarded bad in Korean society. Today, those stereotype is getting better even among older generations, she says. \"Before a person\'s class or status mattered to marry to; higher educated people preferred to get married to similar or higher status people. Those people didn\'t even try to look at lower status people. But Today, higher educated or status people would get married to foreigners. My generation is more narrowed-minded because most of my friends got married to Korean or Korean American guys. A few of my friends got internationally married. It is not depending on the nationality but personal character.\" Even though she doesn\'t want to get married to Americans, that\'s her taste, opinion, and her sense of feeling. She doesn\'t matter whether people around her even her sister would date with American. For younger generation, she doesn\'t think the ethnicity or races should matter as long as they have a good harmony each other; for example, her brother is married to a Korean American woman who is not a pure Korean and having a great relationship.\r\nShe said she has stereotype of  general Korean American guys which comes mainly from the experience with one guy she dated with before. She says \"my friend is married to a Korean American guy and they both look happy to me.\" Even though at the beginning she was saying \"to me personally, I don’t want to go out with an American guy,\" that possibly might be because she is currently going out with a Korean guy from Korea whom she thinks matches with her much more than ex-boyfriend who was Korean American. However, she says at the end of the interview, \"if I didn\'t have a boyfriend and one Caucasian guy happened to see me and would be very nice to me, why not… why not. Women are from Venus and men are from Mars, we are naturally different. \" She believes that most Korea ethnic women in the U.S (not only Korean American but Korean from Korea; whoever thinks she is Korean) would like to get married to a Korean guy (not Korean American). Her parents are highly interested and cared what kind of person she goes out with, educations, occupations (professor or scholars), etc. even though she is not young any more. She gently tells them \"let me take care of this.\" Her current boyfriend is a business.\r\nShe would have her kids go to American school where teaches them English and she will take care of Korean language or culture to teach if she would stay in America.

I grew up in Koreatown, Los Angeles so it was an urban neighborhood that was mostly made up of Hispanics. However, attending a middle school and high school (it was one school: LACES) with a school population of mostly African Americans and Caucasians had me build close friendships with a mix of these two ethnicities. There were many Korean Americans who attended LACES, but I chose to step away from this Korean/Asian bubble and find my niche somewhere else. The people who I hung out with has become some of my best friends and we still hang out together and support one another. \r\n\r\n2. I think I answered this in #1. Today I hang out with a lot more Koreans (as you already know) than I did back in middle school/high school, but like I said I still hang out with the same circle of friends I had at LACES. \r\n\r\n3. Yes.\r\n\r\n4. Yes. I went to Korean School every Saturday and because my dad was so traditional, I grew up learning all of the traditions and customs of the Korean culture. \r\n\r\n5. Yes - - a lot. My dad always reminded me of my roots and where I came from. He constantly stressed how important it was to be Korean and to know everything about it: from the language, reading and writing, to holding chopsticks. \r\n\r\n6. I think both nationalities, Korean and American, are equally important when identifying myself. When I was younger, I think I went through a phase where I didn\'t want to associate myself with the Korean culture. Perhaps this was because of the stress my dad put on me when I was growing up. I hated the fact that Koreans were so closed minded and conservative. However, I am very proud to be a part of such old traditions and customs of the Korean culture today, but I would never be able to identify myself as a full Korean who, say, lives in Korea. I still carry a lot of American traits and the way Americans view things. I think living in America and being surrounded by a lot of non-Koreans, seeing that I go to a private school with mostly Caucasians, makes me closer to being an American. \r\n\r\n7. Everyday. Being involved in church and having a traditional Korean father gave me a huge exposure, but I chose to get away from that as much as possible because my dad forced all of these customs on me a little too much when I was younger. However, being around so many \"Americans\" helps me be more proud of my Korean side because it separates me from the boring American background. I guess it\'s safe to say that I always want to be different wherever I go. \r\n\r\n8. A lot. Yes, I live in an almost all white neighborhood most of the time (Santa Monica, Westchester) but I can always find myself more at ease when I drive back to Ktown to see and hang out with my friends. It helps me see that I\'m part of a bigger and more special culture when being in Korea town.

By then I was really not interested in trying to force my way in anybody’s circle, and I didn’t really know where to start anyway, so I just sort of sat there, and eventually didn’t go anywhere.\r\nMe: Would you define this church as being Korean or Korean-American?\r\nInformant: Yeah. Very.\r\nMe: How so? Besides the fact that the pastor is Korean.\r\nInformant: The kids here are very religious and passionate, I guess. You can see it. \r\nMe: Is that something that is characteristics of Korean churches?\r\nInformant: Well, yeah. You just know that they are very passionate. You sort of get this vibe of passionate-ness.\r\nMe: Kind of like, due to their parents’ influence?\r\nInformant: I don’t think so. At that particular church the parents and kids are kind of segregated.\r\nMe: Like youth groups?\r\nInformant: In that particular group, they are very close-knit. Once they have their group, they are set pretty much, like they will be lifelong friends. Like I don’t exactly know how it works, because I have never been in the circle. But from an outsider’s perspective, I see that they can be cliquey sometimes, but they would be very close with each other, and there might be drama, which I have heard but have not really seen. Kids are generally very outgoing, and they meet with each other a lot of more [outside of church]. They talk about their feelings a lot. \r\nMe: Anything else that makes this church Korean or Korean-American?\r\nInformant: This church? People call each other “sa-mo-nim”, that is very Korean. \r\nMe: How do you feel about that hierarchal system?\r\nInformant: I don’t think of it as hierarchal. I think that’s pretty normal. What really struck me is that non-Korean people were actually using the word “sa-mo-nim”, that’s what struck me as weird. \r\nMe: Are there any other terms that are being used, besides “sa-mo-nim”?\r\nInformant: Jun-do-sa-nim, Sa-mo-nim, Mok-sa-nim… I was actually not that familiar with the hierarchal structure.\r\nMe: So in your old church, that was not used?\r\nInformant: Well, I have been to a lot of churches. The first church was really, really small, so the hiearchal system was not really distinguishable. Like in the big churches that I mentioned where there were a lot of Korean people who were kind of cliquey and stuff, there might have been, I am just not familiar with it, because I haven’t been there long enough to discover the drama or whatever.\r\nMe: So you think the name as associated with cliques?\r\nInformant: No, I think the names are just associated with the leaders, I guess.\r\nMe: Like to distinguish people?\r\nInformant: Yeah.\r\nMe: Do you feel comfortable using these terms?\r\nInformant: Yeah.\r\nMe: Recently, this church has decided to take away these names, and just refer to people as pastors and associate pastors. Do you think this is a good idea, or would you still stick with the old system?\r\nInformant: I don’t know. I think either way would work. The thing with Korean culture is that you don’t address each other by their first name. So everybody pretty much has a title.\r\nMe: I don’t understand this system very well. Can you tell me more about it? Like how would you address someone who is older than you?\r\nInformant: You address them as “jip-so-nim”. Well it depends on who you are. Depending on the age, you would call them “ajumma” or “ajusshi”, or something like “uncle”, or “aunt”, or something like that. And if you are like the same age, and you have age (this only applies to older people), you call them “such and such’s mom” and “such and such’s dad”. This is something that is characteristics of Korean culture in general, the avoidance of direct first names. Like my grandparents, I didn’t even know their first names until I had to do a project that focused on my grandparents and I figured out what their names were, but I forgot they are [afterwards] because you would never call your grandparents by their first names, that’s like the rudest thing you can do. So I don’t think the titles are so much power-structure, hierarchal thing, but more like Korean culture basically avoid using names. I think it is sort of based on respect. I remember at one point my mom tried to change that in the church. She would say, “how are you” and she would address them by their first names, but she was the only person who did that, so eventually she sort of backed down and went along [with the old system].\r\nMe: Is it easier for someone who has that power and authority to do that to someone younger? Or is it only for someone who is younger and addressing someone more respectful?\r\nInformant: No I think it’s something that everyone does.\r\nMe: Here? Or there?\r\nInformant: Like in a general Korean church, expect for the small kids who address each other by first names. But it’s irrespective of age, like when my Dad referred to one of my Korean family friends’ mom, he would always calls her “Alex’s mom”. I don’t think it has any deep meaning to it, she is just “Alex’s mom”, and everybody calls her that. \r\nMe: So here in LBC, we [the college students] don’t interact  much with the CG [Career Group, singles and married] groups, but say you have to ask someone for something, and she is not one of the leaders, how would you address her? Would you feel uncomfortable addressing her? You know her name, but you don’t really know her that well.\r\nInformant: You would just call them aunt uncle.\r\nMe: Would you do that here [in LBC]?\r\nInformant: Like with Korean people here?\r\nMe: I guess the older generation is predominantly Korean, right?\r\nInformant: I guess. I don’t think I would, because this church is pretty Americanized.\r\nMe: How so?\r\nInformant: Because there are a lot of non-Korean people here, so they don’t really expect college students to do that, so I don’t want to stand out and address them in the Korean way.

What were the ethnic demographics of your middle school and high school? \r\nI grew up in a neighborhood of urban settings in the city of Los Angeles. The ethnic demographics of both my middle school (Emerson middle school) and high school (University Senior high school) were majority blacks, Latinos and Asians.\r\n2. Ethnically, what kind of friends did you hang out with while you were growing up? Present day? \r\nI hung out with friends with different ethnic backgrounds, but as I went into high school it became very segregated. People with the same ethnicity would hang out, including me; I started hanging out with only Koreans, and it is still like that today.\r\n3. Do both of your parents work? \r\nOnly my stepdad works at the moment.\r\n4. Did your parents teach you any Korean traditions/customs/language while you were growing up?  (chuseok, new years)\r\nThey didn’t really sit me down and teach me the traditions of my culture nor were never they really the type to celebrate holidays so it was never a big deal to us.\r\n5. Did you parents reinforce your Korean identity? If not, why do you think they didn’t? \r\nNo, my parents never wanted to hinder me in any way from growing into the American culture. Sure, knowing the language fluently in order to better communicate within the family might have been something my Mother wanted but she never stressed it nor forced it on me. She believed that perfecting my English and being American was my number priority because we are living in America after all. Not that knowing the roots of my culture is in any way a bad quality; it’s just not of great importance. \r\n6: As a Korean American, do you favor your American side or your Korean side? Why? This question is important and if you can please write in a detailed response. \r\nAs I grew up, I used to favor my American side because that’s just what I grew up with. Even when I went out and met people, not only is everyone speaking in English rather than Korean, but also the people are up-to-date with the American culture, whether it is entertainment, news, sports, politics, etc. Nothing about my own ethnic culture was tied into all of this. However, as I grew older and met people that are actually more connected to their roots, I realized there was a lot to appreciate. On the other side of this culture, little things like greetings, honorifics, mannerism, and self-image are put into a greater light than the American culture. This made me look and react to people in different ways. It also helped me figure out what kind of people they are just by analyzing these small characteristics. This greater knowledge helped me become the person I am today, so for me to favor one side is difficult. I would have to say that I favor them both equally. \r\n7. How often were you exposed to Korean culture while growing up? \r\nI would say I was exposed to the Korean culture every day because I lived in a town where many Koreans lived. All the restaurants and stores are Korean-owned. Everything was in Korean. \r\n8. How has growing up in Koreatown reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\nI believe that in Koreatown, half of the people are American and the other half non-americans (hi brian, I don’t know another word for ‘fob’ lolll so I put non American). Koreatown helped me reinforce my identity as a Korean American by getting to know both halves. Just like in highschool, the Americans and the non-Americans are segregated in this town, so getting to know both halves really helped me look at people from the bigger picture to the very little of things. I can tell how different the two are and it makes me appreciate both sides. Knowing both sides help me watch the things I do and say—a way to better myself.\r\n','','',0,0),(238,56,250,195,'Fieldwork ','Fieldnotes','1.

Why? This question is important and if you can please write in a detailed response. \r\n	I guess both, but more leaning towards Korean. (not really sure how to answer this)\r\n	ex. In the case of sports, basketball is definitely USA… but world cup/Olympics: I root for Korea\r\n	im definitely more into Korean music/drama/movies than mainstream (excluding hiphop<3)\r\nespecially because of the LA Riots, I definitely have a soft spot for my Korean culture. Through the experience my family faced, I felt betrayed by America … (stereotypes and stigmas that exist)\r\n	But when in disagreements with Koreans (whether clashing with their sense of culture, automatically expecting “sunbae-hoobae” or “unni”/”oppa”) I have a tendency to feel a sense of superiority over them (in terms of respect, one has to give me respect in order to receive it)\r\nSo I feel like im a Koreanized American\r\n7. How often were you exposed to Korean culture while growing up? \r\n	Pretty often. Already exposed to the customs/language at home\r\n	music/pop culture  exponentially increased in high school (in elementary school, most of my friends were latinos)\r\n8. How has growing up in Koreatown reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\n	Food definitely plays a significant role in identity. So when it comes to food/consumerism, living in Koreatown definitely helped (im surrounded by restaurants/lounges/stores everywhere)\r\n	while Latinos are the majority in Koreatown, there is still a great presence of Koreans in Ktown (or at least there was)\r\n9. Has going to church reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\n	Kinda sorta?

Did you parents reinforce your Korean identity? If not, why do you think they didn’t? \r\n-When I was growing up they didn’t reinforce my Korean identity as much as they do now. I think because they immigrated to this country they tried to do their best to assimilate into the American culture and tried to raise us in the American ideals. However, now that my sister and I are older and are steady in our American values, they remind us that we are Korean and remind us of the Korean culture, beliefs. \r\n6: As a Korean American, do you favor your American side or your Korean side? Why? This question is important and if you can please write in a detailed response. \r\n- I’m definitely proud of both but if I had to choose it would be American. I really value the American idea of independence. Independence is something very important to me and something I try to achieve everyday. In Korea independence isn’t stressed as much as it is in America. For example, a majority of the younger adults will live with their parents until they get married which is a lot longer than the standard for young adults in America. Another reason I would favor my American side is because of the level of tolerance and equality in this country. There is still a higher level of discrimination in the Korean culture for women, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. I like that as an American we learn, at an early age, to accept differences and celebrate different cultures. This isn’t as stressed as I would like it to be in Korea. \r\n7.	How often were you exposed to Korean culture while growing up? \r\n-I was exposed to the Korean culture everyday: when my parents spoke Korean to me, when we ate Korean food, when we would watch Korean tv shows, listen to Korean music\r\n8.	How has growing up in Koreatown reinforced your identity as a Korean American?\r\nI dont know if I have to answer this since I didnt grow up there but if you need it, here it is! Lol  \r\n-It has definitely kept me in touch with the Korean community and culture. It has helped me keep up with the current trends in Korea in terms of fashion, music, film. It has also reinforced my ability to speak, read, write Korean. \r\n9.	Has going to church reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\n-I attended a Korean catholic church so being around Koreans/Korean Americans reinforced my identity as a Korean American.

Why? This question is important and if you can please write in a detailed response. \r\n-It depends on the situation. I don’t always favor one over the other. I favor the American when it comes to work environment and education. American companies tend to stay within the 40hr/week range, and few overtimes, but in Korean companies they expect the employees to work overtimes. Furthermore, the American education system allows more freedom to the students. They have the time to volunteer, do club activities, and other activities that are unrelated to books. \r\nI favor the Korean’s culture and the hierarchy system. It is a MUST that the younger shows respect to the older person and the elders. It is not that I want to be respected by the younger people, but it seems like it sets a standard at least. I favor Korean when it comes to affection/friendship between people. Koreans call it “Jeong” which means loving and caring, and it seems like the Korean culture have “Jeong” between the people. They are less independent and care about your friends. Well, this may sound nosy but it shows that they care.  \r\n7.

Since I went to a Korean church, all of the Christian friends are Korean.  Going to a Korean church strengthened my identity as Korea.

There are things about Korean that are hard to know unless you live or have lived there before.\r\nH - Have you ever lived or visited Korea?\r\nA - I\'ve never lived there before, but I have visited a few times. The last time was in 3rd grade, but now that I\'m older... I feel like I would get more out of the experience if I were to go now. Back then, i couldn\'t go out and explore on my own because I was too young.\r\nH - Do you want to live in Korea?\r\nA - Yes! I actually do.\r\nH - Do you think that Korea has things/ideas/anything to be proud of?\r\nA - Korea is one of the countries leading the wave of new technology. I find myself to be very prideful in the fact that Korean products are widely used around the world. Recently, I have also noticed the huge \"Hallyu\" wave spreading across the globe, and I also find myself feeling very prideful of that. This may not seem like a huge deal, but it means that people - not only Koreans - are taking interest in some aspect of Korean culture.\r\nH - Do you think that Koreans are particularly exceptional?\r\nA - I don\'t think Koreans are any better than other ethnicities, but I do agree that Korean people are hard-working and goal oriented. This contributes to the fact that Korean products and culture are spreading around the world.\r\nH - Do you think Koreans are a proud people?\r\nA - Proud?\r\nH - Proud in terms of pride like arrogance or pride like nationalism...\r\nA - Yes.. in terms of arrogance AND nationalism.\r\nH - Why do you think Koreans are arrogant? \r\nA - Well, maybe not any more arrogant than any other ethnicity, but definitely nationalistic.... Based on what I see around campus, it seems like the Koreans are proud of being Korean. When there are events or opportunities to promote our ethnicity, such as KSU or UKV events, it seems like the members are very eager to spread awareness to the other students on campus, it seems like the members are very eager to spread awareness to the other students on campus.\r\nH - Do you hold hostility towards Japan?\r\nA - No, I don\'t hold any particular hostility towards Japan. The issues between Korea and Japan happened many years ago and didn\'t directly affect me, so I don\'t feel like I have the right to generalize all Japanese people and dislike them for what happened many years ago. I\'m sure there were people in Japan who didn\'t have a say in what was going on anyway.\r\nH - How would you describe your attitude towards 1.5 generation Koreans?\r\nA - The majority of my friends at UCLA are 1.5 generation Koreans. There are differences between 1.5 and 2nd generation Koreans. I\'m slightly put off by the fact that growing up in Korea has made them too aware of they are perceived by society. I think 1.5 generation Koreans try too hard to be \"pretty\" and \"skinny\" and fit the general Korean stereotypes of a pretty or handsome person. However, I do like the fact that 1.5 generation Koreans tend to be more respectful of their elders. I adapted very quickly to 1.5 generation culture in this way.\r\nH - Do you think Americans are unaware of how they are perceived by society?\r\nA - No, they are, but I think to a lesser extent than 1.5 or 1st generation Koreans. Because pop culture plays such a huge role in Korean culture, it is inevitable that Koreans, especially people around our age, will use celebrities as standards of beauty - whether it be weight, height, makeup, etc.\r\nH - How did 1.5 generations become the majority of your friends at UCLA?\r\nA - Over the summer, a few people made a facebook group for the Class of 2015 Koreans, and even some sunbaes joined. Through this group we all met each other, and during zero week, we all tried really hard to meet up and hang out. All the Koreans from the facebook group (1.5 generations) were trying to meet each other in person, so by the end of zero week, we all already knew over one hundred other Koreans.\r\nH - Why did you join Hanoolim?\r\nA - I actually joined Hanoolim because I hard a lot of good things about it from my friend, and it seemed like there were a lot of people like me.\r\nH - Which is?\r\nA - Many 2nd generation Korean-Americans who were interested in Korean culture.\r\nH - Is the majority of your friends from your hometown 1.5 generation Koreans?\r\nA - No, I had very very few Korean friends in Oceanside. I was actually the only Korean to graduate in a class of about 700 students. My only Korean friends were friends from church that I grew up with. They are my closest friends, and even though they were born in Korea, they grew up in America with me, so we didn\'t really have any culture differences.\r\nH - So how come you\'re so good at Korean? (language-wise)\r\nA - I attended Korean language school for about 5 years, and my parents speak Korean to me at home. My dad\'s first language is Korean, and even to this day, he cannot speak English fluently so he usually speaks to me in Korean. My mom came to the US when she was very young, so she\'s fluent in English and Korean so she speaks to me in both languages. I have always been very interested in learning languages, so after I stopped going to Korean school, I constantly listened to Korean music, watch Korean movies/shows/dramas, etc. That helped my Korean improve a lot. I had never used Korean outside of Korean school, not even to my parents, so I didn\'t even know if I could speak Korean fluently, but when I came to UCLA, I ended up using almost only Korean, and my 1.5 generation friends couldn\'t tell that I am a 2nd generation Korean.\r\nH - How would you describe your attitude towards 2nd generation Koreans?\r\nA - I think 2nd generation Koreans, especially at UCLA, are divided into 2 groups: the people who are understanding and accepting, and the people who have \"2nd-generation pride\" and who don\'t really like the \"fobs\". I find myself being criticized by some 2nd generation students for always speaking Korean and hanging out with the \"fobs\". I don\'t really like how some, not all, 2nd generation Koreans make it sound like being a fob is a bad thing; instead of accepting the culture differences, they criticize. However, when it comes to competition with other 2nd generation ethnicities, they hold a lot of Korean pride. This doesn\'t apply to all 2nd generation Koreans, of course, and I consider myself to be a strange exception... as do all my other 1.5 generation friends.\r\nH - How do you define \"fob\"?\r\nA - As someone who is more comfortable with the Korean language and the Korean culture than American culture. I would consider most 1.5 generation Koreans at our school to be fobs.\r\nH - What are the differences between 1.5 and 2nd generation Koreans?\r\nA - 1.5 generation Koreans seem to be a lot more conscious of fashion and appearance in the sense that they try to achieve the celebrity-like appearance that seems to be the standard of beauty in Korea. They also are very careful with their relationships, meaning that they always use formal speech when first meeting someone, and they don\'t seem to open up about personal issues as easily. Many 2nd generation Koreans, not all, seem to be more easygoing and easier to talk to from the beginning. They are also less conscious of the standards of society, not to say that they don\'t care about fashion or appearance though...\r\nH - Do you think Koreans are the best at everything or most things?\r\nA - No, they\'re definitely not the best at everything... though there are many things we are good at, not simply for the fact that we are Korean, but because our culture teaches us to be hard-working. \r\nH - In which things are we good at?\r\nA - I think Koreans excel in academics because of cultural pressures. I also feel like Koreans excel in manufacturing goods, like anything from cosmetics to new technology.\r\nH - If America and Korea were to fight in a war, whose side would you fight for?\r\nA - I honestly can\'t choose a side. It\'s like asking, \"If your parents go to war, who would you fight with: your mom or your dad?\". I feel like I have responsibilities to both countries. Korea is the home of my parents, and their parents, and their parents, and etc. No matter where I live, I\'m always going to be Korean. This is why if I HAVE TO choose, I would lean towards the Korean side. On the other hand, the US is my home, and will be my home for a long time.\r\nH - If I ask: \"What are you?\"... What is your response?\r\nA - I always consider myself to be Korean. I don\'t think I have ever introduced myself as anything else. I don\'t even think I\'ve ever introduced myself as Korean-American.','','',0,0),(244,20,258,81,'Korean Kimchi Culture','Audio','An Interview with  Sanghoon Sung\r\nCynthia (Xinya)：Do you like Kimchi?

Definitely my mom knows how to make it well. \r\nC: Could you explaining the steps of making way?\r\nJ: My mom first preserves lettuce in salt for a long time. Then she makes spicy sauce for kimchi, which is combined with meshed red pepper, salted small shrimp, and many other ingredients(like garlic, ginger, green onion, sugar, fish sauce, ). After finish the preserve, she pours the sauce to lettuce and compound with.

For example, Kimchi in Gyungsang-do area (north part) is not salty, because it doesn’t decay easily thanks to the cold weather. However, in Joel-la-nam-do area (south part) is pretty salty, because the kimchi decays easily with the warm weather. \r\nC: Do you (your family) eat kimchi everyday or Korean people eat kimchi everyday?

How many kimchi have you eaten?  What kind of kimchi do you prefer? Why? \r\nD (Dain): I like kimchi. Probably, most of koreans would eat Kimchi everyday. I have eaten many kinds of  Kimchi. There\'s many different kinds of Kimchi such as baechu kimchi (the common one), chong-gak kimchi, gat kimchi, yeol-moo kimchi, kkak-doo-ki, dong-chi -mi and more. My favorite kimchi is Gut-jul-ee(fresh maden Kimchi) and Pa Kimchi(Kimchi made out of green onion). I like most of kimchies, but I think those two kinds are more spicy and delicious than other kimchies.\r\nC: Do you know how to make kimchi?Who is good at making kimchi in your family? \r\nD: I don\'t know how to make Kimchi, so does my mother. My grandmother makes Kimchies for our family and obviously, we love her kimchi than market one. I\'ve heard from my grandmother, she puts many kinds of ingredients and sauce into the kimchi. \r\nC: What and how many food materials does your grandmother make for your homemade special kimchi? Could you explaining the detail and steps of making Kimchi….\r\nD: First of all, the most common Kimchi is called Baechu Kimchi, or Cabbage Kimchi. (The Kimchi you see in most of Korean restaurant). Baechu Kimchi is often made out of cabbage. And its seasoning is usually made out of green onion, white radish, garlic, ginger, salt, salted fish seasoning, powdered red pepper and sugar or honey.\r\n First step: cut the cabbage by half and put the rough salt into each layers of            cabbage\r\nSecond: Leave it for an hour or two, till cabbage get soften.\r\nThird: Rinse it \r\nFourth: Put the seasoning into each layers of cabbage. \r\nFifth: Done for Gut-juh-ree (fresh maden kimchi -one kind of kimchi)\r\n Or wait till it become seasoned.    \r\nC: What are different between homemade one and sale one? (What is the special of your homemade kimchi?)\r\n D: Usually, the sale one from market has less jeotgal(salted fish seasoning) and more flavoring ingredients. But, the kimchi that my grandmother made has several kinds of jeotgal such as salted shrimp, salted enchovies, kka-na-ree, and more.  I think that is why my grandmother\'s kimchi is more pleasant- tasting. \r\nC:   Do you (your family) eat kimchi everyday or Korean people eat kimchi everyday? Do you know how popular the kimchi is in Korea? How important is in Korean life? Why is that?\r\n D:   I am sure not only my family, but also most of Koreans are eating kimchi everyday. I think, Kimchi is really popular to Korean people since long long time ago. Many Korean would say, \"I cannot eat food without kimchi.\" when there\'s no kimchi on the table in the meal. It has taken a deep hold upon a popular mind.\r\nC：Do Korean people give kimchi as a gift to friends? And what does it mean?\r\nD： Personally, when I was young, my families have lived far away from my grandmother who makes the kimchi for our family right now. And the church friend of my mother always made and gave kimchi to our family whenever we needed. I personally think, giving kimchi to other is meaningful between Koreans. It shows the some kind of love called \'Jeong\'.  \r\nC：what a important role kimchi play in Korean culture?

The cabbages、radishes and cucumbers are very popular to use for making kimchi.  First, you should clean it and put it in the salty water for a while, then bring it out. After that, you should make some red pepper paste with many ingredients (Like: chili powder、minced ginger and garlic、some sliced green onions、salt and sugar etc.) Now put on a pair of gloves so that you can mix them and just get right in there, and give everything a solid toss and rubdown. Then you want to bottle the kimchi up in glass bottles, cap them, and leave them out at room temperature for 24 hours. The kim chi will continue to ferment while refrigerated, and will keep for at least a month. The longer it ferments, the more sour it will get. Personally, I prefer kimchi that isn\'t sour at all, so we tend to use these bottles up within a week or so. F or the sour kimchi, I prefer to make kimchi soup.

Was there a purpose or a goal you had\r\nKnew that other people suffered with me and that I wasn’t alone\r\n\r\nHow did you raise up funding to go on this mission trip\r\nThe leader of our group was a head master of Elite, an SAT preparation group so she asked for donations from students who went to the institution and also my family friends also helped\r\n\r\nCan you describe the organization you went to missions with?\r\nThe organization was called It was called walk with me\r\nOur purpose was to walk from city called ban zoon to ocean area called pamanzara\r\nWe would walk with the natives from Indonesia visit schools and talk to the kids there experience the culture and their food\r\n\r\nHow was the dynamics with the group you went with and what relationships did you have with the group you went with\r\nI wasn’t really close with anyone\r\nFirst it was really awkward and uncomfortable because I didn’t know anyone that well so I had a hard time\r\n\r\nWere most of the people going on this mission trip Christian?\r\nYes all of them were Christian\r\n\r\nWere they from different churches?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nHow would you say it was different from being in America or Korea from the culture of Indonesia how did you feel?\r\nWell it was really humid and I didn’t experience this really humid weather before and it smelled like smoke and it was 3 in the morning so I had hard time breathing and all the streets were filled with cars and seemed like everyone was awake and they don’t have any dividers with the roads so they cross with ongoing traffic so I was really scared it was definitely a terrifying experience\r\n\r\nHow did your group handle being in the different culture being born and raise in a Korean family\r\nAll of them were Americanized so incorporating ourselves in Indonesian culture wasn’t too difficult generally had to make adjustments with how we portrayed ourselves we weren’t allowed to cross our arms because that was disrespectful so we kind of had to adapt ourselves but I don’t think the transition was too difficult\r\n\r\nDo you think the culture of Indonesia was that different from America?\r\nDefinitely was because the food and way they dress\r\nEspecially dress because we weren’t allowed to wear tank top or shorts so basically had to wear long sleeve in humid weather which was the hardest adjustment\r\n\r\nCan you describe specifically what you did during this mission trip?\r\nWe met with 20 locals from Indonesia we got together and walked from ban zoon to pamazara walking 10 miles every day and during each day we would visit school and children and experienced their cultures and how the school functions work these kids have never seen foreigners outside of Indonesia before so they treated us like celebrities and that was definitely an unique experience and at the end of the trip we all got together and we all celebrated \r\n\r\nHow many people went on this trip?\r\n40\r\n\r\nHow was the culture like within the group (age/culture differences?)\r\nAll of us were around the same age except one girl who was sophomore in college\r\nEveryone was Americanized no one really stood out\r\n\r\nWhat was the hardest thing about this mission trip?\r\nDefinitely being patient with other before because when you are with a group for 24/7 there are things that kind of irritate you it tested my patience with other people\r\n\r\nWhen you arrived at Indonesia when you were doing your mission work how did people react to you\r\nThey were all very welcoming they treated us like royalty but I saw that a lot of men outside of the group and they looked at us in a creepy way and they were calling us stuff and that was like really not cool\r\n\r\nSo from when you started your mission training till finishing your missionary work do you think anything changed in your perspective of mission work?\r\nYeah like I came out with a mindset that for missionaries like they are very upfront about the bible upfront about Christianity but in this experience that I had we never really shared the gospel straight up it was more of a lesson where we incorporated ourselves into their religion and tried to place ourselves in their culture\r\nIt wasn’t really evangelizing in very obvious way but it was more about blending into a Muslim culture and seeing what they do\r\n\r\nHow was it after you came back how did you feel after being in Indonesia\r\nI felt a lot more humble because the people in Indonesia don’t have it as good as people in America most of the region was very poor so basically I found myself to be very privileged to live in a car with a family food and meals every day I really appreciated our clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants everyday was really annoying\r\n\r\nHow long were you there

Many aspects of the Korean culture have something related to tiger which they call it Korean tiger. The reason that they give it the name after their county which is similar to Chinese Manchurian tiger. Korean people have worshiped tiger for a long history. In 1950, Manchurian tiger disappeared in the land of Korea. Even though the wild tiger had died out, Korean nation still call themselves a nation of gray dragon and white tiger which come from the mythology that gray dragon is the patron saint for the east land and white tiger for the west land.

But \"Huanyin\" intended to test them, so he asked them to stay in a cave for 100 days and ate garlic only. Unfortunately, tiger didn\'t have the patience to wait, it ran out and lost the chance of becoming a human. Sometimes, tiger represents authority and regime in Korea, it is a symbol of justice.

In the last centuries, Jindo dog has been accommodated to Korean geographical environment and cultural condition. \r\nThe excellent traits of Jindo dog can be concluded to several aspects:\r\nFirstly, it will always be loyal to his master. If you have had it for one day, it will follow you for its late life. Secondly, it is gifted the unimaginable ability of homing. When it loses its way, it is able to find the way home. This ability is not so common among dogs, or there will be less dogs missing. In 1977, a television (broadcast) station had made a research of it and reported that Jindo dog would always make it. Thirdly, Jindo dog is good at hunting. It is born to be a hunter who can catch rabbits or deer without the help of the huntsman.

However, several countries in eastern Asian do make dogs for food, because they live in high-latitude areas where the temperature is very low when it is winter, they eat dogs to keep warm.

She says qualities she looks for in her husband is first looks, personality, education level (same or higher) and what kind of job he has.\r\n\r\nShe said it doesn\'t matter which generation she marries. And that she would like to marry someone who was older that her 4 years plus. She would prefer that her husband knows Korean.\r\n\r\nWhat her parents look for are quite the same as her. But she said no criminal record and that he is able to take care of the household. They would prefer someone who was slightly religious, Christianity.\r\n\r\nShe had never heard of matchmaking and does not want to participate in it. She did give an account of match making. It was her Sunday school teacher. He was Chinese and he had married a Korean. They met on an online dating website. (I found that funny that more and more people are turning to the internet to find their significant other. Yeong had also told me a story of how his cousin found her husband on an online website too.)\r\n\r\nShe\'ll consider herself an old maid around mid thirties. But prefers marriage mid 20\'s and late 20\'s.\r\n\r\nShe wants a simple wedding. Beach Themed. Perhaps the mixture of Korean and Western. I had asked her what would she preferred when she had children a girl or boy first. (I really wanted to ask this question to see if it hinted some sort of Confucian value, that males are better.) She did mention that she would want an older boy first but I wasn\'t able to infer if it was because of Confucian values or that she just prefers a boy first to watch over the daughter. She did mention she would want twins. One boy and one girl. \r\n\r\nI had asked if she would keep her Korean heritage like though the continuation of language and Korea holidays. She said that she would want to keep the Korean language and the major holidays which are New Years and Thanksgiving.\r\n','Michelle 1.1.m4a','audio/x-m4a',3923343,1870385),(270,59,242,185,'Soojin Song White Day Interview 1 Part 1','Audio','1st interviewee Soojin Song @ 3/7/2012 11:37 AM. \r\nQ: Hi Soojin. How are you? Are you ready for the interview? \r\nA: I’m very excited. \r\nQ: Can you tell me your birthday and age? \r\nA: 1989. I was born in February. I guessed this is very close to  White Day. \r\nQ: Where did you come from? \r\nA:  I was born in Incheon. Later, I moved to Daejun, central part of Korea.  It is very close to capital.\r\nQ: How many family members? \r\nA: Including me is 5 members.  Parents, twin sister and big sister \r\nQ: Do you live with your grandparents? \r\nA: No. \r\nQ: When do you come to America? \r\nA: Ten years ago. Right after I graduated from elementary school. \r\nA: Never attend middle school and high school \r\nQ: When do you hear about White Day? \r\nA: I know white day from hearing. People talk about white day and Valentine’s day. Beginning on Valentine’s, and March people talked about White Day. \r\nQ: Do you hear from your parents? Or any other sources? \r\nA: you just see whats going on. You hear from news. Maybe advertisements. \r\nQ: Do you talk about in school? \r\nA: Definitely. If you get more candies, it means you are more popular. Number counts. \r\nQ: Do you start receiving candies from elementary school? \r\nA: I started receiving candies since third grades. I think it is even more faster. Maybe from kindergarten? \r\nQ: Do you often watch it on drama? \r\nA: In the drama, they don’t just give chocolates or candies. But, they often buy more expensive stuff like watches and necklaces. This kid of impacts the other people. You actually need to buy more expensive stuff if you love him or her. I think Chinese is sort of like that. \r\nQ: if he buys you more expensive gifts, it means he values more about your relationship? \r\nA: I guess so. If you really care more about her, \r\nQ: How about if he makes you one breakfast or flower? \r\nA: I will definitely accept it. \r\nQ: Will you be satisfied? \r\nA: I will definitely accept it. As long as they care about relationship, I do not really care about the materialistic stuff. \r\nQ: How about if you already bought him a more expensive stuff? \r\nA: In terms of American culture, there is a concept of given take right? I will definitely want something more. Not less definitely. \r\nQ: How many boyfriends did you have? \r\nA: Wait a minute……I need to count…uh 4….\r\nQ: Do you guys all celebrate valentines and white day? \r\nA: They all celebrated it. \r\nQ: What they usually gave to you? \r\nA: Valentines for Chocolate. White Day for candies. \r\nQ: Only candies for White Day? Do they give you more? \r\nA: I got a Tiffany ring, a couple ring. You know couple rings right? It’s very popular. \r\nQ: Were all your boyfriends Korean? \r\nA: Yes \r\nQ: Did they all grow up in here? Or in Korea? \r\nA: One is 1.5 generation like me. One is international student who gave me the ring. The other one was like a Pilipino, but he has a lot of Korean friends. \r\nQ: Do you really care about celebrating this? \r\nA: when I was in previous community college, I always hang out with many international students. When I was with them, I really celebrated it. So I cared more about White Day. But, when I am in UCLA, I paid less attention to this day. I usually hang out with Americans or people who are not Koreans.  Only if I hang out with Koreans, this kind of holiday becomes really a big deal.\r\nQ: How about if they just forget? \r\nA: I will be mad. Forgetting is bad. It’s just like forgetting anniversary. \r\nQ: What do you feel if you receive the gift that does not have good quality? \r\nA: I just got a candle from my boyfriend recently. \r\nQ: what kind of candle? \r\nA: a chocolate candle. Obviously, I do not expect the candle. \r\nQ: So are you not satisfied? \r\nA: I was not satisfied. I was not happy. But I was acting like I was happy about it. But in front of my boyfriend, I was acting like I was very happy about it. If I said something, I am afraid that he won’t give me next year. \r\nA: I actually tell him not to give me a candle, but he already bought it. So it is nothing I can do. \r\nA: He actually bought it online. I didn’t like that idea. I actually like he puts more efforts. \r\nQ; What did you give to him? \r\nA: I also did it from amazon. No, ebay. Actually, I bought a choco massage pad. \r\nQ: Did you receive anything for White Day? \r\nA: I told him not to give me anything, because I am going home for spring break. We can celebrate it together. \r\nQ: Can you find a store here for White Day gift? For white chocolate? \r\nA: A lot people make chocolate or candles by themselves. \r\nQ: What price range do you expect? \r\nA: IF I were give my boyfriend, probably under 50 bucks. Becuz if it is too cheap, I don’t think the guys will like it too. \r\nQ: Do you think one gender benefit more? \r\nA: I feel like guys benefit more. Becouse we make something special, and we put more love in there. Guys spend more money on the girls, and girls do not only expect chocolates and they want more.  Guys sacrifice more for girls’ happiness. \r\nQ: Do you think you put same efforts for him? \r\nA: I think my boyfriends more time. Because he also celebrates pepero day. But my boyfriend comes to United States during high school, so he is more into this cultures, and he wants to celebrate it. Even if I said I do not want to, because we already exchange gifts on Valentines, the American way right? But, he kind of agrees, but he said all my friends do and they might ask me what I did. \r\nQ: When you were in Korea, do you watch Japanese drama? \r\nA: I do not really watch Japanese drama. \r\nQ: Is Japanese drama popular in Korea? \r\nA: They are only popular among some people. But, Korean drama itself is already very popular. It is more popular than Japanese. For me, I didn’t really watch any Japanese dramas when I was in Korea. But, I watched it when I was in United States in high school when I didn’t have anything to do, besides studying. I don’t think Japanese really affect me that much. \r\nQ: Do you think you learn something from Korean drama about celebrating? \r\nA: I am not sure about the way of celebrating. But, it influences me more about the idea of romance. They all have idol type romance including idol idea of celebrating white days. So they all do something special events, like balloon and candle events. \r\nQ: Whats the candle events? \r\nA: It should be surprising right? They will ask the girls come over to the apartment. They will turn off the light, and light up all the candles. And it usually writes ‘I love you’. It happens all the time in Korean drama. It’s very normal. When he did that to me, I do not feel surprising, but I feel ‘yea, I got one’. \r\nA: And if you know the girls or guys in the Korean drama, they don’t get the gifts what they expect. They get mad. I assume that if I don’t give the gifts to my boyfriends, he will get mad at me. \r\nQ: Whats your ideal celebration? \r\nA: I would meet him in the morning. I like to go to the beach or San Francisco area.  I like the idea of exchanging. Most likely, I celebrate both Valentines and White Day. I spent good time on the beach and go to fancy restaurant. It’s typical thing right. \r\nQ: What else you do? \r\nA: I guess we talk about how much we love each other? You know on the anniversary day. IT comes back each year so it just like anniversary day. People tried to get someone when the days are coming so they can celebrate it. So people don’t feel left out.  If they don’t get anything, then that means you are not loved by anyone. It is so depressing. Even girls give to girls. \r\n','Soojin Song Interview Part I.m4a','audio/x-m4a',3923324,1883319),(271,28,210,210,'Overseas Mission Experience (Uganda)','Audio','My fieldwork topic entails the study of Korean-Americans in the Christian community that have embarked on overseas mission trips. Data collected would include the training process, the activities they employ on the trips, the various challenges that were faced, and the meaning created in the reason for their passion to endure through such a strenuous experience.\r\n\r\nWhen and where did you go on a mission trip?\r\nI went to Uganda In the summer of 2010 for 1 month\r\n\r\nWhat made you want to go on a mission?\r\nI have never gone on missions before for some reason I can’t really explain but I felt like I wanted to go this summer.  I always wanted to go on mission and that summer was the first opportunity\r\n\r\nHow were you introduced to this mission trip?\r\nSo I checked out, in freshmen year I checked out the ministry called KCM, Korean-American Campus Missions, They focus on missions so I checked them out for their missions program.  \r\n\r\nDid you join this ministry?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWas it before or after when you decided not to join this ministry?\r\nI was never in the ministry but after the mission trip I considered joining this ministry\r\n\r\nDo you think it was harder before you weren’t in this ministry?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nHow was the preparation like?\r\nIt was really intensive we would meet every week for a month every Sunday there will be mission training.  There were also weekly training, where on food Fridays we would have to finish everything we have on our plate, and on some days we could only use 3 columns of toilet papers.  Stuff like that where we challenged ourselves daily.\r\n\r\nDid you look forward to going to training?\r\nBecause I didn’t really know people I didn’t really like going to training, but during out retreat that’s when we learned body worship and I got to meet people.\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you to endure the hardship of training?\r\nBecause I knew it was necessary, and my desire to go to missions was strong enough that I was able to\r\n\r\nHow did you get funding\r\nSupport letters, and with help of my parents, my mom helped me out a lot asking people at church.  And also my ministry of CCM\r\n\r\nThrough the organization of KCM, how was the dynamics within the group\r\nThere were a lot of diversity, my team had people from every single campus and every grade it was very well balanced.  \r\n\r\nWas your group all Korean?\r\nWe were all Korean\r\n\r\nHow was being there different to being in a Korean group how did you handle it culturally\r\nIt was really a big culture shock but I don’t think being Korean made it harder but just going to place where people live in shacks with no shoes and no food, also the roads were all dirt.  It was just a shock to see such a place after living in America where we are not accustomed to that.\r\n\r\nHow many People went on your mission trip?\r\n11 guys and girls\r\nWas there a leader?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nWas this leader around your age?\r\nHe was around his mid-20s\r\n\r\nWhat did you do on the mission trip specifically\r\nWe traveled through different schools and prisons and we performed body worships and skits and someone shared a gospel message.\r\nHow did you feel performing at school compared to the prison?\r\nThe schools were children so it was much easier but the prisons were not that bad people there were really open and there were even some Christian and there was one that become a pastor while he was in prison so it was really interesting.  At the end few of them because we were with the pastor at the end he asked if anyone wanted to get saved so few prisoners came out\r\n\r\nHow your group dynamics were was there cliques or subgroups\r\nYes, our team cared a lot about what each other thought guys and girls were separated and ages were separated, we had a lot of drama.  Our leader was asked which team he liked better this year or last year but he responded by saying I’m not going to answer but you guys need more prayer.  So we kind of figured.  We could’ve been more selfless to each other.  We had a lot of problem.  We had to have conflict resolution.  Where we had time where we talked and had one on ones with everyone and some of us got to clear things up.  But with me personally I had problems with one person but I wasn’t able to resolve it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think was the hardest part? \r\nI felt spiritually the devil was working against our team so we were feeling homesick and people were getting sick and turn on one another.  It was hard for me because I didn’t really get along with the people so it was hard mental and spiritually\r\n\r\nWhat got you through this hardship?\r\nWhat motivated you to endure the hardship of the mission trip?\r\nJust remembering why I was here in the first place.\r\nHow was it blending into a different culture?\r\nIt wasn’t too hard; the food there was good too.  There were also a lot of Korean foods there because there were Korean staff in Uganda and sometimes we would stay at Korean churches and they would cook Korean food.  So we didn’t miss too much Korean food because it was there for us.  It was also discouraging because in our body worship we used violence to display sadness and suffering but there the adults and even the kids found violence to be something that is funny and always laughed at those parts.\r\nIf there were no Korean food would it have been much harder?\r\nI would’ve missed Korean food and home more but the food there was still really good.  Except for papaya everything was delicious.\r\nHow did the people there react to you or your group?\r\nPeople were welcoming and we were treated like celebrities when we would go to the school and they would chase our bus when we leave.  \r\nHow was it after you come back, what did you learn? Would you ever go on an overseas mission trip again?\r\nI would happy to be home where I was comfortable but I also missed Uganda and the people there.  I would love to go to over sea Mission again if I had the opportunity.\r\nStory:\r\nDuring training we were given duck eggs to eat which had fetuses in them.  I just ate it whole but people ate around it and saw the duck fetus.  I don’t know why they did that; they should’ve just eaten it whole.  This training was so that we would not refuse to eat anything there because it’s disrespectful to turn down food or leave something on the plate. \r\n','Grace Kim Interview.wma','audio/x-ms-wma',19585869,1870391),(272,57,96,149,'Michelle Interview 1.2','Audio','The last part of the first interview with Michelle. 2/2.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMichelle had immigrated to the U.S. around 1997.

She lived with her lover but a day before becoming 100 days; the husband knew she was not human so she could not be the human...\r\nS: So… how about now? Nobody believe that right?\r\nK: Yup..!!

While he was singing, Tokkaebi appeared and ask him how he could sing well and he laid them the voice from the big bump so Tokkaebi took the big bump and also give a lot of fortune to him instead of the big bump. Next day, he met another hokburi man who also wanted to take off the bump and told about what happened to him. So the other hokburi man went the deserted house because he also wanted to have the fortune and sang... suddenly the tokkaebi appeared and they already knew they were fooled so they put the big bump that took off from the first hokburi man to the another Hokburi man..

I think it is very important bird… lol… sorry\r\nS: And, Chinese has the 12 animals symbolic branches, each of 12 animals has their own special meanings in the Chinese history and myths, is there the same thing in Korea?\r\nK: yes! Korea also has Chinese zodiac sign… for example, a baby who was born in this year, they has dragon sign...Korean called it Tti (띠) I do not know the exact meaning of them but it will be similar with China…\r\nS: And the last question….Chinese has a way to explain the meaning of dream, is there any special way used in Korea? And does dream which involved animals reflect any meanings?\r\nK: Korean also considers about the dream... they believe some dreams let they know the future things... such as the dream before baby born was important... they guess the baby will be girl or boy with the dream that calls Tae Mong.  But I can’t tell everyone has taemong… I just told you about dragon dream before right? And also tiger dream is a dream of boy and people believe the boy will be a great guy... and there is a dream of pig. If person dreams the dream of pig, he/she will get the fortune.

Setting was noisy because it was a public place but not distracting; two people could easily carry a conversation. I prepped her as much as I could about the reason for the interview so that she would not be awkward and stiff.\r\n\r\nSuyoung’s experience with Korean traditional dance started in elementary school. She attended an elementary school in South Korea and her teacher mentioned to Suyoung’s mother that Suyoung seemed to enjoy dancing. So Suyoung’s mother sent her to a dance company’s audition and she made it in. She began dancing after that, particularly Korean dance. The company’s policy stated that she had to attend a performing arts school in order to stay in the company so Suyoung chose Korean traditional dance as her major. For the next 3 years of middle school, she majored in Korean dance. When she moved to America upon graduating middle school, she continued it as a hobby at a Korean dance studio in Los Angeles. \r\nLife in a Performing Arts Middle School\r\nSuyoung was primarily doing more modern dance in elementary school and her middle school ensured that she learned the basics of different dance styles. She attended선하예술학교, a private performing arts middle school in Seoul. During her first year, she just learned the basic moves and dances of the different dance styles. Her 2nd and 3rd year consisted for of different types of dances. Her regular day would consist of 7 periods, 2 of which had to be dance classes. Then there would be additional dance lessons after school. All in all, she danced about 8-10 hours every day. She would always be dancing during the Christmas and New Year’s breaks too because she would have 2 dance exams every year and they always fell after the breaks. Her entire school consisted of about 1000 kids who were divided into 7 classes. The first 2 classrooms consisted of art (미술) majors, the 3rd classroom was dance majors, and the last 4 classrooms were instrumental majors. \r\n	Suyoung’s class was further divided into 3 sections: the ballet section, the regular Korean dance section (her section), and another Korean traditional dance section called Little Angels. The Little Angels was created by the same founder of her middle school and was considered a more performance based group. Her teachers were pretty well-known and were usually alumni of the school. Suyoung also mentioned that her teachers’ teachers were also very well known; one of her teachers’ teachers was the head or president of the national dance company of Korea.\r\n\r\n-graded on physical appearance too—body shape & everything\r\n-when you’re in that school, everything you do, even if it’s crazy, you think it’s what you’re supposed to do so you don’t even know if it’s crazy until you graduate & hear other people’s experiences\r\n-private middle school\r\n-dormitories mainly for international students; couple Japanese students & white students\r\n-middle school population 1000 people\r\n-classes that she liked: teacher would turn on music & given a time limit & you have to make up a dance & show it to the class; enjoy it\r\n-difference between people who learn dance at hakwon & people who attend performing arts school\r\n~their goal is to go to an arts high school; more systematic experience; dance is not just after school, it’s part of their school \r\n-different people make different routines that you learn\r\n-first year you learn 김기본 (?); a person who’s last name is 김 made the dance (김백봉 who was one of the really famous pioneer of Korean dance in Korea); after that learn 박기본 or something like that afterwards\r\n-would also learn drumming, gayageum, ballet (her minor)\r\n-if you’re a Korean dance major, you have to have a minor that’s not Korean dance\r\n-first year you have to do ballet; by third year you could switch to modern dance but she preferred more structured stuff\r\n-first year is just basics, but starting from 2nd year, learn 무당춤, 부채춤, and a lot of made-up play-like dance\r\n-every year had a big performance to show what everyone learned that year\r\n-first year was 흥부전; 10 Korean dance majors so they were 흥부’s kids, all the poor kids, so they had to order all their costumes & their costumes were like rags (걸레)\r\n-2nd year, story about brother & sister and goes on a journey to find medicine for sick parents\r\n-3rd year, bagoonee chum where you dance with bagoonee’s\r\n-here was mostly what other people think traditional dance is like fan dance, crown dance, jangoo chum, and 3 drum dance\r\n-when she sees her friends in Korea, they don’t do that kind of dance anymore; they usually make their own dance & then perform\r\n-in Korea, the teachers taught you, but here, at hakwon, everyone is at a different level, so the teachers teach everyone, but individually, you learn from your unni’s or people who have been there longer, so that’s how she learned how to teach, but here the unni deul take care of you\r\n-some of her friends have been dancing for a long time, but if they didn’t learn it from an unni, they don’t really know how to teach\r\n-teachers aren’t specific; they just say general things\r\n-unni’s tell you how they learned so more specific\r\n-if she stayed in Korea, would not be able to teach as specifically\r\n-when her dance friends and her hang out, they always talk about the performances because people get closer when they go to performances together because they get ready together, & they remember if they made mistakes\r\n~one of her first performances after moving here so she was really nervous and unsure about the routine, and during fan dance, she was turning & doing her thing and then she saw one of her friends and her dress is falling down & she didn’t know what to do so her teacher had to pull her off stage\r\n~during a lot of the performances, the fake hair that they usually wear fall so there are little black things on the stage here & there (laughing)\r\n~when they have big performances, do 3-4 dances & have to change in between and sometimes people wear other people’s costumes and the person left w/ nothing are so confused\r\n~more than just learning it, performing is a lot different and it’s fun\r\n~those are the things that we still talk about after 10 years, the performances\r\n-came from Korea to US in high school (9th grade); right after middle school so did not even apply to arts high school\r\n-talked to friends who went to regular middle school (in Korea) & their experiences very different\r\n~she got to choose what she was going to do for life at young age so that she could build up her skills & prepare, but her friends who went to regular middle school said that most of them really confused & lost in the middle because they don’t know what they want to do for life\r\n~for us, while other people study & do other stuff (dating), they didn’t because they were always at school; after regular classes, they had to dance & they end around dinnertime or after that, so literally home school home school\r\n~don’t regret it, but would have been nicer if she could’ve done other things (wistfully)\r\n•	Friends got to volunteer at random places but she didn’t \r\n-afterschool practices, teachers are there with you; regular class but after class (laughs)\r\n-dance classes about 2 hours long; afterwards 2-3 lessons 4-6 hours; then when big performances coming up, even more lessons (end around 10-11pm)\r\n~lived far from school so slept over friend’s house a lot\r\n-went home just to sleep\r\n-(in comparison with regular Korean middle school students) they study, but don’t really develop another talent\r\n-very close to her middle school friends; always talked about if they would dance for life because come into school at 13-14 years old\r\n-most of her friends have remained dancers in dance companies or teachers\r\n~different sizes of dance companies: national (big) ones—job is to dance, smaller ones meet couple times a week\r\n-want to get into national ones for name\r\n-school is famous one so don’t want to “downgrade”\r\n-name of school \r\n-commuted from Ilsan; 2 hours there & 2 hours back so had to get on the first train at 5 am & would come home really late & just sleep or not at all\r\n-don’t really know what we see differently about performing arts schools because all her friends are from the same situation \r\n-go to other performances w/ uniform to represent school\r\n-sunbaes always told them to roll up the skirts to look prettier just in front of the other schools; when you’re at school, you have to make it lower\r\n-sunbae/hoobae year is strict especially at performing arts school so first year you could only wear black stockings; 2nd year you could wear nude stockings; 3rd year knee high socks; the unnis decide\r\n-one of her friends had dyed her hair a lighter color & the unnis told her to dye it back to black, but she couldn’t do it on time cuz of lessons so every day she had to color her hair with sharpie or she would get in trouble\r\n-unless practicing for annual performance, never saw sunbaes dancing\r\n-summer break, had poongmul camp, so learn drums for 3-4 days straight, so you got blisters\r\n~eat, drum, eat, drum, but it was fun cuz they went somewhere else & sleeping over w/ friends\r\n~poongmul camp was inside the mountains\r\n-no traditional dance camp cuz they did it every day; summer was for focus, intensive courses\r\n-3 departments (ballet, hers, Little Angels) put together 3 hour annual performance & w/in her department’s hour, there were 3 classes (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year)\r\n-her year got lucky cuz got to go to Japan to perform and had a lot of performing opportunities compared to her unnis\r\n-performances almost every week during her 2nd year; and 3rd year went to Japan for 10 days during summer break\r\n-fun because got to meet North Korean performers as well Japanese group, Chinese group, & a group from Macau or something like that\r\n-event was the UNESCO so people from different countries came & they dormed together for around 10 days\r\n-got to talk to North Korean kids; they are known for their crazy practices; they were little kids and they said their teachers were scary\r\n-where else can you meet north Korean kids\r\n-got to see other countries’ performances\r\n-performed what they had already been practicing\r\n-performed fan dance & a made up dance\r\n-in Korea, they make up dances & rather than traditional Korean clothes, they wear more modernized clothes\r\n-in Korea, called jang jak muyeong\r\n-at competitions, 2 different categories: traditional dance section & jang jak muyeong section w/in Korean dance\r\n-before she went to middle school, she went to their competition & did traditional dance\r\n-started late in comparison to others; she started 4th grade but most people started younger\r\n-before you go to arts school, she was learning at a hakwon\r\n-4th grade to 6th grade was part of Little Angels group; wasn’t allowed to go to another dance hakwon, but went anyways because she didn’t want to be a part of the Little Angels group in middle school; she just went to the regular Korean traditional dance department\r\n~went to the competition so that she could get extra points on the entrance exam\r\n~performed 살푸리, a solo dance\r\n~met every day after school from 4-7pm\r\n~danced & sang\r\n~Little Angels & her middle school were connected cuz by the same founder\r\n~in high school, Little Angels & regular traditional dance become one\r\n~in middle school, it was ballet, Little Angels & Korean dance; in high school, it was ballet, modern & Korean dance\r\n-once entering middle school, it’s usually group dances & people going to performing arts high school are recommended to go to competitions so that they can get extra points for the high school entrance exam\r\n-as the performing arts students, you know about the competitions & could ask for private lessons\r\n-most of the dancers have to have long hair because they have to tie it back when they dance, so all of the dancers, when they take a break or when they quit, the first thing they do is cut their hair\r\n~so she had a little break when she moved here but soon found her dance place so she didn’t get a break until 2nd year of college so first thing she did was cut her hair really short; her dance studio teacher said all the girls did that; has been growing her hair out since\r\n-could never cut their hair short because always has to tie it especially middle school high school because you had to look clean; would not get points taken off on the physical portion of the dance exams\r\n-teacher said your body is the instrument for them so have to take care of your body\r\n-the girls were always on a diet\r\n-her class was the dance class, so they ate a lot because they moved a lot\r\n~her class had 2 trashcans & every day, they would have to empty them both out twice, but right before exam, it didn’t even get full halfway because everyone is on a diet\r\n-she’s done no water diet where if she gets thirsty, she would wet her mouth with water and spit it out; it could get intense but she didn’t find it hard; I was shocked\r\n-one of her friends was in the ballet section & she found out she wasn’t going to grow anymore, so she went on a crazy diet; for a couple months, she would only have 200ml of milk and 1 small goguma a day on top of dancing 8-10 hours a day; she became very (pointed inwards to her cheeks while sucking them in)\r\n-schools would have sports day so except for tug-a-war, her school would win everything because they were the dancers; they were fast because the other students have to sit while playing instruments but they were always moving\r\n-also, in Korea, they would tell you your rank in the class and your rank w/in the entire school; 1-50 in PE was all theirs (dance class)\r\n-4 classes just for music but differentiated to\r\n-45-50 kids per class\r\n-her school was coed but her dance class had no guys (her sunbaes & hoobaes did); but usually, the ratio of girls and boys was very big; 2-3 guys to 40 girls so the boys become pretty feminine by the end of the year & when changing for PE classes, girls would change in the classrooms & make the boys wait outside or go to the bathroom\r\n-but the girls would get very comfortable with the boys & would treat them like one of them','Suyoung (I).mp3','audio/mp3',11027072,1873819),(276,36,31,221,'Interview Notes with Andrew Chang','Fieldnotes','Notes from interview with Andrew Chang taken on my computer.

When I had asked him what he looked in prospective marriage. He said he had no standards. He doesn\'t care about tradition or modern weddings. He would however, marry about a year or two after graduation. He would like to marry early. Around 25-26. But doesn\'t necessarily care when he gets married. He would consider himself too old to be a bachelor around 35.\r\n\r\nFrank is a first generation Korean immigrant from Korea. He had left Korea because he wasn\'t doing very well in the Korean schooling system. That is why his parents decided to move to the U.S.\r\n\r\nHe considers himself a very leftist person. He has no religious affiliations (As of now). However he was Christian before. Although his friend Yeong also mention that not too long ago he was under the influence of Won Buddhism probably a year or two ago.\r\n\r\nHe had a very strong personality. He would marry someone 4 to 5 years older than him. However he will only marry someone 2 years max younger than him. He stressed that English is a must because he wants to communicate.  He does not see himself ever returning to Korea for long terms.\r\n\r\nIn terms of being filial he wants to spend time evenly with both sides of the family patrilineal and matrilineal. He doesn\'t mind if his wife has religious affiliations as long as she is not imposing or too overly religious. But he stresses an emphasis in education.\r\n\r\nIf he would marry a Korean. He would like to spend certain year in Korea, when he has a child. So that the child can learn Korean. \r\n\r\nHe mentions that he does not have a lot of Korean friends. He says that he use to go to church. And that he felt that church in America was more comforting than church in Korea. He sees it as a social network. (like many of the other Koreans I\'ve interviewed.)\r\n\r\nI asked him what was the typical stereotyped first generation Korean.\r\n\r\nHe had said someone that smokes/drinks, South Campus major, Christian, meticulous of age and hierarchy. \r\n\r\nHe also mention how much he hated hierarchy. He related that back to his relationship to Yeong. How that even though Yeong is older than him he see their relationship as equals because his education is higher than his friend. Both are first generation but seem to lack the formalities of hierarchy that is usually present in Korean society.\r\n','Frank 1.3.m4a','audio/x-m4a',3923537,1876250),(278,59,270,213,'Sooyeon Choi Interview White Day 2','Audio','My name is Sharon.

Although it was a more casual, informal environment than all my other interviews, she still answered as if it were more of an interview rather than us just having a friendly conversation. I asked for a second interview because the first interview with her turned out to be very strained for the both of us since we both did not really understand the requirements of an interview.\r\n\r\n•	Experience with KCN Traditional Dance—has been doing it for 3 years. She does not feel like she has learned a lot because she feels like she is not learning legitimate Korean dance. The students teaching her have had prior dance experience, but she has not. Her first year, she did 부채춤 and 탈춤. She did pretty basic movements, but for 탈춤, she did a fusion dance along with regular 탈춤 with DJ DOC “Run to You.” Her second year, she did 화강무. She did not know about it at all, but she learned that it was a dance that you do in the royal court. That was something new and something that most people do not think of Korean traditional dance. When people think of Korean traditional dance, they think of 부채춤, 북춤, 장구춤, but this was a totally different thing. And the 한복’s that year were really nice. Her first year costumes were really ghetto and nasty. This year, they are doing fan dance, but it is different from the one she performed her first year. This is because both her coordinators have learned it from UCLA’s Korean dance program, so they are incorporating moves that they learned. Also, some of the girls on her team have done Korean dance in high school, so they are more flexible about the range of movements they can do. There is one move that they refer to as the “corkscrew move” in which everyone is lined up and creates a continuous circle of fans that looks like a corkscrew. Also, there are several other moves that are completely new to her. One similar move from her first year’s performance, however, is where you open your fans, you jump, you squat, turn, and you jump up again. \r\n•	Movements from this year’s KCN Traditional Dances\r\no	During her first year, some of the moves that she did were made a wave, a mountain, and a valley with fans. But she felt like nothing was special about the movements her first year; they were all just basic. They made a large flower, with an outside layer and an inside layer, with a butterfly. They also made a two person, small flower. They also did a lot of spins.\r\no	This year, they are making 3 flowers. The first time 2 groups are making flowers. The last time, everyone gathers to make one larger flower. Also, they are doing a move (could not catch the name) where you open your fans to show your face. She also does two spins. They are the hardest because it requires you to keep your arms straight and to show off the fan by keeping it aligned with your arm. When they are doing the “jumping move” (mentioned above), they have two circles, which is not usually done because it causes a distracting performance, but to conserve space, they are doing it like that. There are also a lot of partner moves, where there are two rows. \r\no	Another interesting move that she remembers is opening one fan down and the other fan up with one foot pointing out, then spinning. This is her favorite move because she really finds it pretty.\r\no	The whole dance this year is to show off the fan.\r\no	She finds it interesting that in fan dance she has to cover her face at least at one point. Even when they enter, they are covering their faces.\r\n•	Her idea about basic movements in Korean dance:\r\no	The basic movements are spins, which is one of the difficult ones because you have to twirl on your heels; opening up your fans and moving it around whether it is straight out, to your side, or straight up; and going around in a circle with your fans.\r\no	The basic spin is a two-step move. You go on your heel, use it as your pivot, and turn around in two steps.\r\n•	To her, the first dance at KCN was not that memorable. \r\n•	The practices and the performances are memorable in their different ways. The practices are memorable because she gets to get closer, share a lot, and have girl talk. The performances are memorable because everyone is nervous, everyone is dressed nice, everyone has their hair slicked back, everyone is wearing the crowns, and everyone is just cheering each other on. You do not remember anything that goes on the stage, except for the mistakes.\r\n•	Dynamics between your teams—first year, Leeza was the coordinator and she was definitely Korean American. And the people who were on the team that year mainly consisted of people in her year and some first years. Suyoung also helped make the choreography. Her second year, Suyoung was the coordinator, and she was fob, but it did not make much of a difference. Most of the people on the team that year were people who had tried out the year before. There are not a lot of non-Koreans, but at the same time, there are not a lot of fobs. This year, the team dynamics are different because everyone is from different student groups. Dance-wise, the auditions process was very tough. There is only one person who has never done traditional dance before. However, everyone is Korean-American, but one of the coordinators is pretty fob. But, it does not really matter because everyone is nice. During her first year, though, everyone got closer because there were a lot of unnies so they took care of the freshmen and sophomores a lot. During her second year, everyone was around the same age, so it was more of a friend environment. This year, they do not all know each other, so it is a little more awkward.\r\n•	She likes more traditional Korean things, so she really enjoys traditional dance. It is something that is relaxing and fun and it is something she can try doing. It is a good way to experience something that in a sense is kind of new, but is still part of her culture and is not necessarily bad to know about.\r\n•	Most memorable experience—the experience in general is something that is going to last with her. Not a lot of people have had the chance to do this every year, but she has. So it is bringing something to the community. Even if the performance is short, she sees all the back work and all the preparation, and it is really nice to see the production going on. She is not offering much, but it is something she can say that she did and something that was not a waste of time, just because she has had so much fun, met so many people and got to see the preparations.\r\n•	Favorite part—after the performance when she gets to just watch the other performances. She does not like the dressing up phase, except for the 한복. She loves한복, but she expressed her dislike of her costumes this year as well as her first year. The costumes were made years ago and they are still in use today, so the costumes smelled and the 한복 were brown and stained. Her second year, though, the 한복 was clean and pretty with vibrant colors. \r\n•	American dance vs. Korean dance—American dance shows off the person and the shape of the person, while Korean dance is more about the dress, the fans, and the movements. In Korean dance, everything is covered so the only thing that is noticeable is the dress and the instruments you are holding.\r\n•	She expressed her dislike of the hair and makeup required by Korean dance.','Esther (II).mp3','audio/mp3',34681984,1875067),(280,49,277,220,'Fieldwork Project Data','Audio','Recording of second interview with Esther on 03/14/12.','Esther (II).mp3','',0,0),(281,57,37,219,'Yeong 2.1','Audio','The first part out of three. 1/3 Yeong\'s second interview.\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nI asked him to come prepared with some stories of matchmaking or weddings.

He gave me three stories. The first one is on his sister.\r\n\r\nHis sister graduated from UC Berkeley. She was working for the Congress in Sacramento when she met her future husband. Her husband by chance was visiting Sacramento when he saw her. He began to talk to her and even got her contact information.\r\n\r\nAt first she was quite hesitant. She was not looking for a relationship at that time and wanted to only focus on her job. However they did meet a couple times and after 6 months of rejection by her. She finally gave in and went on a date. The were dating for two years before they had gotten married.\r\n\r\nHe was a 2nd generation Korean-American. She was a 1st generation Korean. Their marriage was very lavish and very western. Nothing Korean was incorporated into their wedding. Only the closest friends and family came and mostly they were the groom\'s guests. The guests were given airfare and hotel rooms for 5 days.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd story is on his cousin. His cousin is a woman. She use to study in Japan and graduated there. After graduation she went back to Korea. She met her husband on an online dating website. Her husband is Japanese. They got married after a while. At first the family was hesitant of their marriage. They much rather her to marry a Korean because of the language barrier. She has dual citizenship from Korea and Japan. She has 2 girls and she teaches Korean in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe third one is about matchmaking of an acquaintance. The acquaintance is a woman. She got married around 29. She met her husband through matchmaking through the father. This was taken place in Korea. The girl\'s father\'s friend\'s son. It was her first matchmaking but it wasn\'t his first matchmaking. The first impression was good. He drove to restaurant. Yeong talked about how matchmaking would usually be taken in a restaurant or in a scenic place. \r\n\r\nThey dated about 4-5 months before they decided to get married. It was about less than 20 dates. The difference in age was about 6 years from wife to husband. He was the older one.

You said you grew up in church, right?\r\nI: Yeah, a church in Nor Cal, Gracepoint Fellowship Church for 14 years.\r\nMe: Do you think there are a lot of similarities between that church and LBC?\r\nI: Well, the similar part is that both churches view fellowship as being the most important.\r\nMe: Would you classify both churches as being Korean or Korean-American?\r\nI: The first church that I went to is more multi-ethnic, here it is more Korean.\r\nMe: So what are the characteristics that you think make this church Korean?\r\nI: I don’t know, just the food and how people interact with each other.\r\nMe: Can you elaborate on that.\r\nI: Like how we address each other by a hierarchy, like older brothers and sisters [in Christ]\r\nMe: So what are some of those names?\r\nI: Hyung is for older brother, like how a guy addresses an older guy, Noona for the guy addressing the girl.\r\nMe: What about the pastoral staff?\r\nI: Well I guess here we just say pastor and for the pastor’s wife we call “Sa-mo-nim”\r\nMe: And what about Mok-sa-nim and jun-do-sa-nim?\r\nI: Uh-huh.\r\nMe: Do you feel comfortable using those terms? Or do you prefer the American way?\r\nI: Very comfortable with the Korean terms. I don’t mind using both.\r\nMe: Why is that?\r\nI: I just grew up with it.\r\nMe: Was that also used in the previous church that you were attending?\r\nI: No, not in my previous church, since it was trying more to mix up the culture, so we only used English.\r\nMe: So this is the first time that you have encountered these names, but you like them?\r\nI: No, the other churches I’ve visited, they did it too, in Korean churches. But this is the church I stuck with, that does have a lot of Korean culture. \r\nMe: Recently this church has decided to drop these titles, what do you think about that? Do you think you will continue to these titles?\r\nI: I will continue to use them, but I guess it is a good idea to drop them because not everyone here is Korea, and know what the titles mean. I think it will be a little more helpful to be a little more American here.\r\nMe: Aside from the way that people address each other, do you think there are any other cultural practices at this church that makes it Korean?\r\nI: I don’t really notice, so I don’t think so.\r\nMe: So you mentioned something about the food?\r\nI: Well there is Kimchi, and sometimes they serve other Korean dishes.\r\nMe: And it was less so in your other church?\r\nI: We did have a lot of Korean food, but a lot of other food too.\r\nMe: Some people I have interviewed talked about the style of prayer. Do you have any comments on that? I think it’s a common practice. More personally for me, a lot of Korean churches that I have visited prefer to do group prayer, like everyone praying in unison and out loud. I heard it’s a common Korean practice.\r\nI: Uhh. No. I don’t think I heard about this Korean practice about praying, but generally I think it would nice to be prayed in a group, because it’s more helpful with people, just more supportive of each other, praying together. \r\nMe: In the future, in terms of church membership, if you are checking out other churches, would you prefer to stick with a Korean-American church or just anything-goes.\r\nI: It’s doesn’t really matter about the ethnicity, but I prefer a smaller setting, a small church where people can get close to one another other easily, more easily than a mega-church. \r\nMe: The way this church is run, do you think it makes you feel like a spiritual family. Does the fact that it is Korean-American make you feel like it’s more at home?\r\nI: Not that, it’s just I feel it’s more laid back, it’s how people interact with you, they just want to get to know you, not to judge you. And once they get to know you, they show a lot of concern for you, so I think that’s kind of key for church to make you feel at home.

Since my freshman year, so this would be my second year.\r\nMe: What were your first impressions when you first started attending this church?\r\nInformant: There were young people here.\r\nMe: What do you mean by “young people”, like little kids?\r\nInformant: No. The church that I grew up with, there was like nobody my age, so I just sat there all alone, so [when I came here,] I was like oh my God, there are people my age! So that was really exciting.\r\nMe: So that’s something that really attracted you?\r\nInformant: Something like that, yeah.\r\nMe: Do you think that this church and the church that you came from in any way?\r\nInformant: Similar in the way that… I think the prayers are kind of similar maybe, like in the end where he [Pastor Daniel] is like, “let’s pray”, and everyone is praying their own thing. That kind of reminds of me how my Dad used to do prayers when we were kids. There would be grown-ups praying and that would last a very long time. \r\nMe: Like how long, approximately?\r\nInformant: I don’t know, we were really small kids then, oh this is another church where there were still not kids my age, they were all younger than me, so I had to take care of them. So I don’t really know exactly when they start, but I had to stay and keep an eye on all of them until their parents are done, and that would take quite a while. I don’t know exactly when they start, I know they would socialize and have dinner and all that stuff first. And then somewhere along the line, people start praying, but I don’t exactly when all this starts and when it ends, all I know is that it would take quite a while.\r\nMe: Have you ever participated in these group prayers?\r\nInformant: No, too young.\r\nMe: Do you know what it is like?\r\nInformant: Kind of. Like as in they sit in a circle and pray.\r\nMe: Altogether? In unison?\r\nInformant: Uh-hmm\r\nMe: Like out loud, right?\r\nInformant: Uh-hmm\r\nMe: Are there cultural customs or practices or even things practiced in this church that you find kind of strange or unfamiliar with? When you first started attending this church, were there any practices that struck you as being odd or unfamiliar to you? Likewise, on the other end of the spectrum, anything that made you feel like this is very familiar to me, this is like home?\r\nInformant: I am not really sure. I guess the fact that people interact with each other so much, that is kind of new. Like I said, I am not very connected back in my younger days, like no church friends. Like you just go to church on Sundays and that is it. [Here,] people actually meet up with each other, and I learn that retreats exist, and that small groups exist, and I never knew about these types of things. I guess that is new. Old… the basic structure of this church is stuff that I am familiar with. \r\nMe: Familiar or unfamiliar?\r\nInformant: Familiar, or maybe it’s because I have been to many other churches.\r\nMe: In LA or back home?\r\nInformant: LA and home.\r\nMe: Were you looking for something that is Korean-American or were you ok with anything?\r\nInformant: Mostly Korean-American church, but I never really fit in. Korean-American churches tend to be cliquey, so newcomers have a hard time adjusting into it. By then I was really not interested in trying to force my way in anybody’s circle, and I didn’t really know where to start anyway, so I just sort of sat there, and eventually didn’t go anywhere.\r\nMe: Would you define this church as being Korean or Korean-American?\r\nInformant: Yeah. Very.\r\nMe: How so? Besides the fact that the pastor is Korean.\r\nInformant: The kids here are very religious and passionate, I guess. You can see it. \r\nMe: Is that something that is characteristics of Korean churches?\r\nInformant: Well, yeah. You just know that they are very passionate. You sort of get this vibe of passionate-ness.\r\nMe: Kind of like, due to their parents’ influence?\r\nInformant: I don’t think so. At that particular church the parents and kids are kind of segregated.\r\nMe: Like youth groups?\r\nInformant: In that particular group, they are very close-knit. Once they have their group, they are set pretty much, like they will be lifelong friends. Like I don’t exactly know how it works, because I have never been in the circle. But from an outsider’s perspective, I see that they can be cliquey sometimes, but they would be very close with each other, and there might be drama, which I have heard but have not really seen. Kids are generally very outgoing, and they meet with each other a lot of more [outside of church]. They talk about their feelings a lot. \r\nMe: Anything else that makes this church Korean or Korean-American?\r\nInformant: This church? People call each other “sa-mo-nim”, that is very Korean. \r\nMe: How do you feel about that hierarchal system?\r\nInformant: I don’t think of it as hierarchal. I think that’s pretty normal. What really struck me is that non-Korean people were actually using the word “sa-mo-nim”, that’s what struck me as weird. \r\nMe: Are there any other terms that are being used, besides “sa-mo-nim”?\r\nInformant: Jun-do-sa-nim, Sa-mo-nim, Mok-sa-nim… I was actually not that familiar with the hierarchal structure.\r\nMe: So in your old church, that was not used?\r\nInformant: Well, I have been to a lot of churches. The first church was really, really small, so the hiearchal system was not really distinguishable. Like in the big churches that I mentioned where there were a lot of Korean people who were kind of cliquey and stuff, there might have been, I am just not familiar with it, because I haven’t been there long enough to discover the drama or whatever.\r\nMe: So you think the name as associated with cliques?\r\nInformant: No, I think the names are just associated with the leaders, I guess.\r\nMe: Like to distinguish people?\r\nInformant: Yeah.\r\nMe: Do you feel comfortable using these terms?\r\nInformant: Yeah.\r\nMe: Recently, this church has decided to take away these names, and just refer to people as pastors and associate pastors. Do you think this is a good idea, or would you still stick with the old system?\r\nInformant: I don’t know. I think either way would work. The thing with Korean culture is that you don’t address each other by their first name. So everybody pretty much has a title.\r\nMe: I don’t understand this system very well. Can you tell me more about it? Like how would you address someone who is older than you?\r\nInformant: You address them as “jip-so-nim”. Well it depends on who you are. Depending on the age, you would call them “ajumma” or “ajusshi”, or something like “uncle”, or “aunt”, or something like that. And if you are like the same age, and you have age (this only applies to older people), you call them “such and such’s mom” and “such and such’s dad”. This is something that is characteristics of Korean culture in general, the avoidance of direct first names. Like my grandparents, I didn’t even know their first names until I had to do a project that focused on my grandparents and I figured out what their names were, but I forgot they are [afterwards] because you would never call your grandparents by their first names, that’s like the rudest thing you can do. So I don’t think the titles are so much power-structure, hierarchal thing, but more like Korean culture basically avoid using names. I think it is sort of based on respect. I remember at one point my mom tried to change that in the church. She would say, “how are you” and she would address them by their first names, but she was the only person who did that, so eventually she sort of backed down and went along [with the old system].\r\nMe: Is it easier for someone who has that power and authority to do that to someone younger? Or is it only for someone who is younger and addressing someone more respectful?\r\nInformant: No I think it’s something that everyone does.\r\nMe: Here? Or there?\r\nInformant: Like in a general Korean church, expect for the small kids who address each other by first names. But it’s irrespective of age, like when my Dad referred to one of my Korean family friends’ mom, he would always calls her “Alex’s mom”. I don’t think it has any deep meaning to it, she is just “Alex’s mom”, and everybody calls her that. \r\nMe: So here in LBC, we [the college students] don’t interact  much with the CG [Career Group, singles and married] groups, but say you have to ask someone for something, and she is not one of the leaders, how would you address her? Would you feel uncomfortable addressing her? You know her name, but you don’t really know her that well.\r\nInformant: You would just call them aunt uncle.\r\nMe: Would you do that here [in LBC]?\r\nInformant: Like with Korean people here?\r\nMe: I guess the older generation is predominantly Korean, right?\r\nInformant: I guess. I don’t think I would, because this church is pretty Americanized.\r\nMe: How so?\r\nInformant: Because there are a lot of non-Korean people here, so they don’t really expect college students to do that, so I don’t want to stand out and address them in the Korean way.

I was in the sixth grade, and my sister invited me. Basically she moved to LA after she was a missionary in Japan, and she invited me to this church.\r\nMe: What were your first impressions when you first started attending this church?\r\nI: People are really nice. \r\nMe: Have you been to other churches before attending this one?\r\nI: Yeah I did. I attended another church before this one. It was my parents’ church. It was a local Korean church near my house in Torrance.\r\nMe: A local Korean church, was it…\r\nI: It was a Presbyterian church.\r\nMe: Ok, was it very Korean? \r\nI: It was… well the youth ministry was in English, but the general service was in Korean.\r\nMe: Do you feel that there are similarities between this church and that church in this Korean-ness?\r\nI: No, I see more American-ness in this church. That’s part of the reason why I stuck around here. ‘Cause I couldn’t really connect with people at the church that I used to go to. It was in Korean, so I couldn’t really communicate or anything.\r\nMe: So you wouldn’t define this church as Korean-American?\r\nI: Not right now. I would say maybe ten years ago, yes. And I think it’s become more diverse.\r\nMe: When we are speaking of Korean and Korean-American, do you think there are any cultural practices that are being practiced in this church that makes it Korean-American? Like the way that people refer to each other with Korean titles?\r\nI: Yeah.\r\nMe: What do you think about that?\r\nI: I personally… I think we should change. Our church is getting more diverse. People who are not Korean won’t understand what that is. But at the same time, people who have been in this church are obligated to… well, not obligated, but it’s a norm for them to use it because it is a way to respect their elders, so it goes both ways for me.\r\nMe: So personally, which way do you prefer?\r\nI: I prefer that we take it off.\r\nMe: In terms of addressing other people who are not a part of the Pastoral staff, but people who are in the Careers group, how would you address them? Do you feel uncomfortable?\r\nI: No, I don’t feel uncomfortable. I address them on first-name basis. And it also depends on your relationship with them. People I’ve known since when I was a youth, I can call them the Korean name… hyung. Usually I don’t. I feel comfortable just calling them their first name.\r\nMe: Someone else brought up this concept of prayer. That it’s very distinct for Korean-Americans, especially for Korean-American churches to pray in unison and out loud. Do you have any comments about this?\r\nI: What do you mean?\r\nMe: From what I have heard is that this practice where people gather together and pray together in unison, vocalizing the words together through prayer, it’s a more Korean practice, do you associate this with being Korean? Or is it something you are used to?\r\nI: I think it’s pretty Korean. \r\nMe: Why?\r\nI: I don’t really see it in modern-day American churches, but we don’t only do it here like this at Life Baptist. But I do remember that stuff when I went to my parents’ church.\r\nMe: Why do you think it was done that way?  Do you have any ideas?\r\nI: I just don’t know. I guess it’s pretty traditional. I am not even sure. I just remember it in my parents’ church. It was a little bit scary, because everyone was speaking in Korean, and I didn’t really understand.\r\nMe: In terms of churches and your Korean ethnicity, when you are looking for a church, does ethnicity matter to you?\r\nI: Personally, it doesn’t really matter to me. Just wherever I feel comfortable, wherever I can grow with God, it’s important to me. But it does help to have some Korean friends, but it’s not my priority when looking for a church. ','Interview With David Choi(1).wma','audio/x-ms-wma',751300,1876454),(292,29,274,212,'Korean-American Church Culture Interview With SK','Audio','Me: How long have you been a part of this church or campus fellowship?\r\nInformant: I have been since 2004, that’s when I came here for undergrad, so since 2004.\r\nMe: So what were your first impressions when you first started attending this church?\r\nI: My first impression was people seem very serious about listening to the messages that the pastor would give. You know, people would respond, like altar call, when the message is heard, people would go forward and respond, to ask for prayer or rededicate their lives and commit to Christ. So that’s what struck me.\r\nMe: Do you grow up in a church similar to this one at all? \r\nI: Different in the sense that I grew up with my parents’ church, which was just a Korean-American church, which was obviously mostly Korean-Americans. This church is mostly a mix of Asians, and few other people of other races.\r\nMe: You mentioned Asian-American church. What are some characteristics that would define as church as being Korean-American? \r\nI: Well, their ethnicity would be Korean-American.\r\nMe: Are there any cultural rites or practices that are commonly found in Korean-American churches?\r\nI: Korean-American churches, they have an adult Korean service, and then I think to allow the younger generation to receive the message and everything, they accommodate for them and have an English service. So growing up… I grew up in the youth group ministry, and it was all English-spoken. But my parents would go to the Korean-language service. So that’s what’s different, ‘cause here it’s just the English-speaking service.\r\nMe: So would you define this church in particular, LBC, as being Korean-American?\r\nI: No, it’s not classified by any race. It just so happens once you know one Asian person, one Asian friend has lots Asian friends, so you know, it’s not… I mean, it used to be called, Asian American Koinonia Fellowship, but…\r\nMe: When was this?\r\nI: That was when I was a freshman\r\nMe: Do you know when they changed the name?\r\nI: They changed it… 2010 or 2011, I am not sure.\r\nMe: Are you familiar with this church’s history? From Berkland [Baptist Church]?\r\nI: Not really, because obviously I came after…\r\nMe: So someone brought up the system of addressing pastoral staff with Korean names such as Sa-Mo-Nim and Jun-do-Sa-Nim, what do you think about this? Was this practiced in your church back at home? Or is this the first time you encountered this?\r\nI: Yeah, people did address… In Korean culture, especially when you are addressing somebody as Pastor and Pastor’s Wife, or Deacon, they have a title, and you address them kind of out of spiritual respect. So yeah that was like a normal thing for me. But what I didn’t grow up with was that… I grew up in a such an Americanized home that I didn’t call my oldest sister “Unni”, which is like older sister. I learned that that too, is like, though I grew up differently, you should still be respectful when addressing someone spiritually more mature than you or older than you, you say unni or oppa.\r\nMe: Is that something that you use on a regular basis while interacting with older people in this church?\r\nI: I do, but not for everyone. \r\nMe: Just with people you are familiar with?\r\nI: Yeah.\r\nMe: Recently this church decided to drop these titles, and just refer to pastors as Pastor, what do you think of this? Do you think it is a wise choice? Or do you prefer to stick with the old way?\r\nI: Yeah, I think it’s good in the sense for someone who is not Korean and not really familiar with the terms and not understand that there is a good meaning behind it, so yeah, I don’t see it as a bad thing. I see it as a good thing. It’s not like when people will drop it when they are told to drop it. If that has been part of someone’s relationship, then it’s still going to be there.\r\nMe: You were once interning for the undergrads and you were saying about this spiritual respect. When younger college students address, how do you feel about this age gap? Do you prefer that they call you unni? Or by your name directly?\r\nI: I don’t mind, either way. It’s not I expect it, I really don’t. I’m fine by people calling me by my name.\r\nMe: Someone [I was interviewing just now] brought up prayer style in Korean church, do you have any comments about that? Just the unique way that Korean-American churches conduct prayer? Group prayer, in particular?\r\nI: I mean, I grew up mostly hearing from youth group and children’s ministry, so it wasn’t much different. I don’t really think I understand your question.\r\nMe: The question is more like the style, in terms of praying together, like out loud. In some of the [non-Korean American] churches that I visited, this was not commonly practiced, so when I first came to this church, I was a little distracted when I was doing my personal prayer. So when everyone prays in unison, what do you think about that?\r\nI: I think there are so many ways you can pray, there is not one way. Like, what I do know is that it says in the Bible, when two or more come together in His name, God answers prayer. So whether you are talking out loud, whether you are walking and looking at each other and praying together, whether you are praying by yourself, I don’t think it really matters. It’s about where your heart is at. To me, it’s just another form of prayer, I mean I didn’t see it as being distracting. I mean people might be used to praying a certain way, and so yeah.

This is Sharon.I am going to interview Minji @ 3/9/12. \r\n\r\nQ: When is your birthday? \r\nA: Sept. 20th 1990. \r\nQ: Your major is? \r\nA: Chemical engeerniering \r\nQ: When you came to America? \r\nA: I came here last September. It’s been six months. \r\nQ: Are you going to stay here for a year. \r\nA: full academic year. I am going back maybe June and July. \r\nQ: Do you live in the city before?  \r\nA: Yea, I lived in the city and I was born in the city. Last couple years, since my university is in capital city, so I live in the city. \r\nQ: Do you feel the differences between your hometown and Seoul? \r\nA: Actually, if it is my hometown that it is not big as Seoul, but it is still a city though. I’ll say it is not big different though. But, if it is at the countryside, it has a big difference though kind of like less exposed to the advertisements. \r\nQ: Did you see many advertisements on White Day? \r\nA: Yea. Shops, something likes supermarkets. They always have white chocolate or candies right? But one or two days before White Day, they would promote it more than ever. They put the candies and chocolates in front of the shops at the entrance, so everyone goes there can see. They try to promote it that way. And also, online advertisements for online shopping and shopping malls. You can also see commercials on TV. \r\nQ: Do you see more advertisements in Seoul? \r\nA: Yea. I think so. We celebrate more that kind of events. The bigger the cities, the bigger the events. \r\nQ: Do you see any special events on White Day? \r\nA: I don’t remember that special. But, I remember like all of the coffees, especially coffees, fill with the pinky stuff. Sometimes, they have special menus for White Days. Sometimes like bakeries have special menus for White Day or Valentine’s Day. It also happens to all the holidays, such as Korean SAT Day, Valentines’ Day, Pepero Day, and Christmas. Bakeries are very sensitive to these events. I cannot say that is an event, but maybe it is a way of advertisement. It is like a nation-wide event. \r\nQ: How do you know about White Day? Do you know it from your friends, parents, and advertisements? \r\nA: I don’t remember how I exactly learned it. I might learn it from my friends in elementary school. Or, from upper-schooler or upper grader.  There are people who always lead the trend in school. They do something like White Day stuff. I noticed the event from them I guess. \r\nQ: Did you watch Korean drama at the time? \r\nA: At the time, actually I didn’t. But, I watched it during middle school and high school. I watched it a lot.  \r\nQ: Do you have more senses about White Day after you watched the drama?\r\nA: Actually, it didn’t change that much. I mean the Korean dramas didn’t influence that much about White Day. But, my friends influenced more cuz like when I was younger, even though they celebrated each other the White Day, they celebrated obligatory. Or, all of them were exchanging, not to anyone specifically.  They gave to the person whom they like in elementary. It was kind of like a chilling day for exchanging candies. But, when I went to middle school, it became more serious about girls and boys something like proposing. Uh..since I didn’t have any boyfriends at the time, I didn’t receive candies from anybody. But, I could see a lot of people exchanging their candies or chocolates in the relationship with others.  \r\nQ: When you didn’t have boyfriend, did you feel jealous when you were in middle school? \r\nA: Ohhh…..mmm. Sometimes, maybe I might unconsciously. I might think like that. Sometimes, they kind of like showing off. The guy gave a really huge package of candies, then that girl who received that even though she tried not to showing off, but it was so obvious. I would think that she’s popular and pretty, and imagine that I may get something like that in college or when I have boyfriend. It became like an ideal. So, basically on Valentines’ Day and White Day, I should give or receive something like that. I kind of unconsciously learn that kind of stuff by my friends doing that. It is not because of Korean drama or commercial, but it is from my friends. \r\nQ: Are you currently in relationship right now? \r\nA: Actually, no. \r\nQ: How about before? \r\nA: I once had in college when I was in freshman. \r\nQ: Did you receive anything on White Day? \r\nA: It was kind of a ridiculous story. I didn’t give him anything on Valentines’ Day, but he gave me something on White Day. I feel I was kind of bad. \r\nQ: Why you didn’t give him anything on White Day? \r\nA:  Cuz that Valentines’ Day was during New Year holidays. I was out of the town at the time so we couldn’t meet. After I came back a week later, it was meaningless to give anything a week later after Valentines’ day. I only texted him about ‘Happy Valentines’ Day’.  But, it was all actually. I didn’t expect that he’s gonna give me something on White Day. I mean it is ok if we don’t exchange anything on White Day or Valentines’ Day, cuz I kind of realized that White Day doesn’t really exist. I mean Valentines’ Day has a history right? But White Day was kind of made up by a person who I don’t really know. So, I kind of realized that White Day is more about commercial. I mean it was really okay, not a big deal. He gave me a box of candies and one pack of chocolate. \r\nQ: Did he feel disappointed? \r\nA:  Im not sure actually. He might be disappointed. But guys tend not to show and sensitive to those kinds of events. But, the problem is the girl. The girls care a lot. I mean not all the girls care about every single event, but I would say most typical girls care about. When their boyfriends skip these kinds of events, they would be disappointed. Even if I didn’t give me on Valentines’ Day, but he didn’t give anything on White Day, I would feel a little bit disappointed cuz yea for some reason. I just kind of expect. \r\nQ: Will you discuss about White Day with other girls what you received? \r\nA: Um..like I think some girls might talk it. But, comparing the gifts is like the immature way. What a silly conversation. It is actually between you and your boyfriend, not among you girls. But, people still talk about this kind of stuff. But these days, people talk about some negative stuff on White Day cuz people are kind of realizing White Day is commercialized. It was kind of big event for middle and high school students. \r\nQ: Do you really care more about other holidays? \r\nA: yea like anniversary that will be more meaningful. \r\nQ: Do you have any ideal way of celebration? \r\nA: Since I don’t care that much about prince range, I still kind of expect. My ideal way is just like having a fancy dinner with my boyfriend, or maybe get a small box of candies to remind that it is White Day. \r\nQ; Do you think any gender benefit more? \r\nA: yea. I think guys are more giving than girls. Girls are kind of receiving more. I don’t know why but I feel it is kind of universal. Isn’t it?\r\nQ: Do you think if the guys give more that means the guys are more protective? Or, it represents that the guys have the ‘face’ for not embarrassing the girls?\r\nA: Well….I think that the given take way is changing. It becomes more equal. If the person earns more, that person should give a little bit more. \r\nQ: I assume that if the guys give you more stuff, that means he cares about the relationship and he makes you look among the other girls? Do you feel that way? \r\nA: Well, I don’t think so. Sometimes, it will be a good treat to flatter girlfriends to give her really expensive present or something. But, sometimes it doesn’t really work that way. Paying more doesn’t mean loving more. A person who earns more should take care more of the other. That will be more fair I guess. \r\n\r\n','Min Chih Interview Part I.wma','audio/x-ms-wma',11701429,1879108),(294,59,58,225,'Minji Kim Interview White Day 4 Part II','Audio','Please see part I description.

Because Yukgaejang is hot and spicy, it is eaten often during the summer, because in Korea people believe consuming hot foods during the summer is good for personal health. It came from Gaejangguk (also known as Bosintang or dog soup), but for the people who cannot dog or who prefer not to eat dog, they used beef instead of dog meat, which became Yukgaejang. The main ingredients of Yukgaejang are usually bracken, oyster mushrooms, and a brisket of beef. My family is from Mokpo, a city in the southern province Jeonlado, so cooking there is a bit different from other people in different regions of Korea. In my family, my first aunt is known as a “master cook”. Her food is amazing and I recorded a video in the summer of 2011 when I visited her during my summer vacation. She still lives in Mokpo, which is also my both parents’ hometown. The video took place in her kitchen, and my mother was helping her cook as well. According to my aunt and my mother, to prepare the dish, one or two onions are needed and should be cut in pieces. One or two green pumpkins and green onions are necessary as well. In a frying pan, a small drop of cooking oil and a half spoon of dried red pepper powder should be added. When boiling, it becomes chili oil. Next, add beef in a pot with some nicely aged soy sauce, salt, and crushed garlic. The basic soup (not finished yet) with beef, nicely aged soy sauce, salt and garlic can blend to become many different soups; an example would be seaweed soup. Nicely aged soy sauce is called Jinganjang, but she said it’s called Aeganjang in her area. My mom said beef in America might not taste as good as beef does in Korea when adding it in this mix. Next, the chili oil must be poured into the pot with the basic soup. She does not hesitate to conserve and save as much chili oil as possible. Last, put all of the vegetables in the pot: onions, green onions, and green pumpkin. The addition of green pumpkin is what separates this dish from ordinary Yukgaejang. Green pumpkin helps the taste of Yukagejang. My aunt’s Yukgaejang is one of my favorite foods. One notable highlight of the video is my aunt’s very strong southern Jeonlado accent.','Yookgaejang.m4a','audio/x-m4a',3369490,1136970),(296,38,282,243,'Making Gochu japchae','Audio','Gochu japache is made with shredded fresh green chili peppers and vegetables. When I think of Gochu japache, I think of Chinese Korean restaurants where I can have Jajangmyeon, Jjambbong, and Sweet and Sour pork or beef, because Gochu Japache is usually served in Chinese Korean restaurants. The dish is usually served with steamed burns, probably because it is spicy. According to my mother, you want to have green bell peppers, onions, bamboo shoots, pyogo mushrooms, and pork. After that, you need to cut the green bell peppers by 1.2 cm into pieces, cut the onions, bamboo shoots, and pyogo mushrooms the same size as the green bell peppers. The pork then needs to be drained and cut into pieces. Fry one teaspoon of soy sauce, jake (saenggangsool), and eggs each. Cut green onions, garlic, and ginger into several pieces. Then, put everything that has been cut so far and fry it in a frying pan with some cooking oil. After all of this preparation, you have Gochu japache! According to my mother, Gochu japache is food that you want to eat when you have no appetite or when you have to serve a visitor at your home. It usually takes thirty minutes to cook; however, my aunt—whom I consider a cooking master—and who taught me how to cook Yukgaejang, said it only takes ten minutes. When I asked my mom for tips on how to prepare the food she said that she usually uses spicy peppers instead of green bell peppers, but if the dish is too spicy using paprika or glass noodles will add flavor to the dish. Also she said it is better to put soy sauce in the dish before you put the meat broth into the fried ingredients. My mother also told me after the interview that she is a very fast cook, and she does not put much in her Gochu Japache every time she cooks it. She recommended only putting in beef, pepper, garlic and the sauce. However she manages to cook it, my aunt must be a very fast cook.

It started off with Korean music and media. I always wanted to go to Korea, and when I came to college, I knew that was the best time to go because they offer study abroad programs. Once the summer came about after my freshman year, I decided Korea because it was also my area of study. \r\nS: What’s your major?\r\nN: My major is currently Korean.\r\nS: Wow, so did you learn the language before you went?\r\nN: Well, during my freshman year, I took a year of Korean. But during high school, it was pretty non-existent in my high school and in the area where I lived too. So it was difficult to get your hands on a Korean course.\r\nS: So you had just heard through the media about Korean culture and music? \r\nN: Yeah. \r\nS: K-pop?\r\nN: Yeah, I guess. \r\nS: What were some of the artists that you followed or listened to?\r\nN: Some of the artists that really struck me were people like Big Bang. I don’t think 2ne1 was out yet, but like sonyŏ sidae. I didn’t really listen to Super Junior. I didn’t really like them. But Pak Hyo Sin. \r\nS: Like Korean ballad?\r\nN: And Lee Sŭng Chŏl. Yeah, some of the older ballad singers too. The language itself is something I really enjoy listening to and just speaking, or learning about. \r\nS: So you went with UC Irvine through EAP. How long did you stay there for?\r\nN: My story is actually pretty complicated. I stayed there in the summer from the end of June to the middle of August. I didn’t actually live in the dorms, I stayed in a home stay family that I had to find myself. The school didn’t really help me, but I really wanted to do home stay. I was so scared, but a week or two before I left, they gave me a family. I didn’t know what to do until they finally told me. So that’s how long I stayed there, yeah.\r\nS: So it was just a summer?\r\nN: Yeah.\r\nS: What year was that?\r\nN: Summer of 2010.\r\nS: Can you describe the family you actually stayed with?\r\nN: I stayed outside of Seoul in Koyangsi, I don’t know how else to explain it. But I stayed right below Ilsan. When I got the information about them, I just got a page of their interests and a photo of them. I don’t know how easy it is to understand a family through a picture, but I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into. When I got off the plane, I didn’t know where I was going. Once I asked for a ticket, the bus I was supposed to take was behind me, and when I turned around it was leaving. I had to run after it. Beside that, I met the host mom in the city and at the bus stop. She got my stuff and pretty much, over all, they were a really nice family. The father didn’t live with the family. He lived in another city east of Seoul because the whole money issue. There was an older sister who went to Koryodae and the younger brother attended high school. The mother itself was really nice. She was one of those moms who was really into healthy foods, cooking everything by scratch. It was really good. She really worked really hard as a house mother. She took care of me like one of her own kids. So that helped a lot. I got to only stay there a month because apparently they were going on vacation, or the family had to go to her husband’s house somewhere else. So she gave me a week’s notice saying that I had to leave and find a place on my own. I didn’t know if they should’ve done that, but I was scared out of my mind. I found a kosiwŏn.\r\nS: What is a kosiwŏn?\r\nN: A kosiwŏn is a one-room or an area or building where students live in. It’s like an apartment or a dorm, but it’s very secluded. Each room is to each person and they pay rent for that room. It comes with a bed, a TV, storage, a mini-fridge, sometimes comes with its own inside bathroom. I moved to a kosiwŏn right next to Yonsei University. I should’ve said earlier that my trip down from my home stay family down into Seoul was about 30-40 minutes by train. Also, it was tougher moving because I grabbed all my stuff in two suitcases and went to the city and found my own place. I guess doing everything myself I was pretty lucky. The home stay family was really nice, it was just that whole situation where halfway through the trip, kind of put me in a very scary situation for me.\r\nS: What was your expectations of Korea before you went? And how did it change or match your expectations?\r\nN: Before I went to Korea, I’m the kind of person that does a lot of research before I go somewhere like a trip or country. And from what I’d heard, I had heard of international students who could get into conflict due to cultural differences. But then again, you need to appreciate a person’s cultural differences or situation. For myself, I didn’t know what I was getting myself into because I only had one year of experience in Korean and going there, I thought I was going to be more outgoing but I think I kind of tried to mesh into everyone there. And by meshing in, you keep to yourself more. That’s how I feel about Korean society, people keep to themselves when I first went there. And it’s an image I still kind of have on my perspective of Koreans. Actually, once I got there, my home stay family, my sister, really helped me to open up to people and allowed me to be a little more outgoing because her friends wanted to meet up with me and talk to me and speak to me in English. But overall, my original perspective was that I had to watch what I do, what I say, where I go. The whole respect issue.\r\nS: Can you tell me a little bit about that? What do you think about Koreans and what is the respect issue?\r\nN: So, respect and honor system there- it’s much more public, I guess, where I was surprised that when you go on a subway and all the seats are taken, you’re kind of obligated to give up your seat for an elderly person. Then again, I would do that here because I think I’m a nice person. But it’s much more obligatory there, and the biggest thing I noticed about respect was at the supermarket or at the malls. The service is so amazing, they really cater to you. They also have certain mannerisms that show that they respect the customers and respect who comes in. I found that very interesting and I wish they had more of that here unless you go to a business that is much more fancier. I saw more of that going to the supermarkets, or the department stores.\r\nS: Did they notice that you weren’t Korean? And if so, how did they react and treat you?\r\nN: When I lived in Koyangsi, I guess you don’t really see a lot of foreigners, so when you go to the supermarket, they all speak to you in Korean. But of course, when you go to Sinchŏn n near Yonsei or Kangnam or Myŏngdong, you get a lot more people or workers who look at you and can already tell you’re a foreigner and would prefer to try to use their English than speak in Korean. Especially when you go to Dongdaemun, at this big department store with little stores inside, and all of the guys would speak in English and say all of these phrases that you know that they’ve memorized. And they just throw them at you because obviously, they know that a billion foreigners go through there all the time.\r\nS: So you were saying that there were areas where they only spoke Korean to you. So they just assumed that you were Korean?\r\nN: I think they knew, I mean it’s kind of obvious because I’m darker and my looks are not very Korean. I think they sort of new, but then again, I don’t think they got a lot of foreigners coming along those parts. Especially when you get the workers that are a little order. In the case that they’re older, they’ll just speak in Korean. Even when I had younger workers that I came across, they would speak in Korea. Because you’re in that area, they don’t assume, but in the back of their minds, I’m sure there’s an idea that, Oh, this person must know some Korean to get by. So basically, the phrases that they would use in those situations were very common, I think. So it’s easier for them to say something in Korean and it’s easier for me to understand it because it’s not complicated. \r\nS: Do you have any stories to share? Or an experience where you had that language barrier or miscommunication?\r\nN: I had to get my cell phone by myself. I had a cell phone that my friend gave me that I took to Korea. That was the worst situation I was in because it took me literally the entire day just to get it fixed. When I was in Sinchŏn I had tried to activate the phone, but I didn’t know how to register. So the guy told me I had to go to a service center in Korea which was about 10-15 minutes away walking. At the service center, they tried to get very technical with the words and I had difficulty understanding. They just said, go back to the place you came from. So I went back there, and they told me to go to a different cell phone store. And I was just thinking, what the heck is going on. Finally, they said that the phone was registered was under someone else and that’s why it didn’t work for you. So we cancelled that registration and you have to make a new one. I swear, that was five or six hours of walking around and it was really crazy. At the last store, there had been Korean girls who also were getting their phones, but they spoke English because they were from America. So they explained to me the final conclusion to my situation. They helped me out. But that was one of the worst situations I was in due to miscommunication and trying to do things on my own.\r\nS: How was your experience with the food there?\r\nN: You know, I was really surprised because I went to Korea expecting to eat Korean traditional foods. \r\nS: Like what?\r\nN: I don’t know why, but I thought I would be eating a lot more sŏllŏngtang or kalguksu or like a lot more mul nengmyŏn. I thought I would be eating a lot more of traditional banchans and stuff, but when I went, it was already 2010, and they had a lot of American or a lot of European fusion foods like mixed with Korean style. They had cheese fries, or Mr. Pizza. Everyone likes Mr. Pizza. They had fried chicken and beer, and a lot of stuff, you’ll never see in America, but you’ll see in Korea. Like cheese ttŏkpokki. I really liked Korean food because it was a kick to the American food here. But I guess when I didn’t get a chance to eat Korean food, I was surprised to see how cheap it was. It was good. Then again, I thought, I had eaten a lot of Korean food here, and then I thought, there’s nothing that really struck me in terms of Korean traditional food. When I went to Kyungji, I ate their ppang. And it was really good. I don’t know if people understand, but I heard they’re famous for it. And when we went with EAP, I tried it and it was pretty good. \r\nWhen I was in Pusan, they had hottŏk there. I had eaten hottŏk before. It’s usually like sugar and it’s fried. But then over there, this is something that really sticks to me now, I can’t have it anywhere else, they put a mix of seeds inside it, and for some reason, it was the best hottŏk ever. I ate three. \r\nS: So you traveled a lot in Korea. Did you go by yourself? Or did you go with others? \r\nN: So the trip to Kyungji and the trip to Pusan was with EAP, but the Koyangsi thing was kind of on my own. I would’ve wanted to travel a little more, but because of budget, I had to find places near the school and the place I was staying. \r\nS: What did you think about the fashion there?\r\nN: I thought it was pretty amazing because it’s the type of fashion I really like. It’s simple and lines, the shape of the clothing is very important to me. Fashion isn’t that important to me, but the way that it looks and wearing it, of course I have to like it. When I was in Kangnam, that was like the Mecca of most of the fashion I liked on people. So when I was waiting for my friend there during the world cup games, I decided to sit there and look at all the people and see who I thought could be a model. And the thing is, so many people passed by and I was counting every single person. Everyone was so fashionable, and the thing is, you wouldn’t see people like that unless you’re in New York or LA but the way they dressed, and the designs of the clothes, you wouldn’t see unless it’s very high fashion or expensive in America. I also saw stuff that people only had in dramas. Lee Minho had this backpack in a drama that looked like a water-pack, and I saw this guy with it, and I was just like, Where did you get that? In Kangnam, that’s where I saw the high fashion stuff, especially because that’s the high-class area. In the Dongdaemun and Myungdong, you’ll see a lot more casual stuff. Stuff you could probably see people wearing on a daily basis. When I was in Pusan, there was some trend with Hollister and Aeropostale, and A&F. They had their own labels, but it was so reminiscent of that, and I was surprised people still like that stuff. Especially since it’s outdated here. \r\nS: Did you have to learn how to bargain when you went to buy stuff?\r\nN: Actually, before I went, I learned about bargaining, especially in Asian countries. And I tried to practice bargaining here, but you can’t really do that here unless you’re at a flea market. But once I was in Korea, my best bargain was when I asked for shoes. You just play off, I don’t really remember. I just asked for a discount because I was a student and I was poor and I was broke, I tried to get on their good side. They were like 20,000 won? And I got it for like 12,000. But you can’t really bargain for the bigger purchases I guess. I tried to do that in a clothing store in Dongdaemun, and they were kind of high fashion, so I told myself I wouldn’t try it since how much lower could I get if it was that expensive.\r\nS: Do you have any funny stories to share, just about your time there? Something that sticks out?\r\nN: I remember a time when I got lost on the subway. The subway, I got used to, but someone I knew lived down south more past Kangnam, so it was much farther out of my range of where I usually went. So in the subway line, if you look on the map, it goes up and right, but I ended up transferring to a subway that went up instead of down, and when it went up and I ended up somewhere else. I fell asleep and when I woke up, I was like, what the heck. And it was about a thirty minute trip. All the other memories were situations I didn’t expect myself to get into.\r\nS: Did you ever see any traditions or holidays or anything like that?\r\nN: Would the World Cup be considered a big thing?\r\nS: Do you consider, from what you witnessed, it to be a big thing?\r\nN: I would say it was a pretty big thing. When I went, obviously, it was World Cup season. And South Korea, it sent some nationalism and pride for the team. It was so amazing. The color and theme was red. It was like red everywhere, promotions or ads on the buildings from K-pop singers to actors and actresses. But during the World Cup games, every pub was filled with people, every bar, every street. When I went to Coex, it was so packed. It was amazing, I don’t even know how to explain it. Even though I’m not Korean, obviously, and I went, I got a sense of pride myself. And a sense of hope for the team. Once you get into it, it feels amazing because you feel like you’re a part of something. I wore red too, and cheered for the team. It was sad when we lost. One of the biggest things was that when I was sitting down with everyone at Coex watching the game, I would look into the buildings, and you would see all of these office workers looking down at the screen also. So like, it was felt by everyone. Beside the World Cup season, I guess I didn’t really catch much. \r\nS: And you mentioned you’re going again? \r\nN: Yeah, I already bought my ticket. I planned it with EAP, but I don’t know if financially I could go with them. I told myself if that’s the case, I’m just going to go because I can’t really refund my plane ticket. I was going to go and try to find a more, I guess, traditional image of Korea. I wanted to go past Seoul if I can, and down south more. I talked to some friends who lived between Kyŏngju and Pusan area, the more… not like Seoul. I wanted to go into the mountains and see farms and see traditional neighborhoods or something like that. I wanted to see if it was possible to get a less urban image of Korea and less urban perspective on it. From what I’ve been hearing from a lot of my friends, especially because I’m a Korean major, a lot of people talk about Korea and Seoul. Of course, there’s Pusan, but you don’t really hear about people who have an interest in the traditional aspect. I don’t know how else to put it, but I guess like the mountains, the region, the different locale. I’m just wondering if it’s possible for me to see something like that. I know it’s going to be hard, but I really want to try something like that.\r\nS: Why do you think it would be hard for you to go into that area or stay in that area? \r\nN: I thought about it for a while, and for the reason why it would be difficult for me, I kind of plan what I bring. So I’m not sure if I would be used to going and caring less and going into areas on my own and being a little more, asking for help more? In the sense where I need to try to figure out where to go and not put myself in a situation that’s dangerous and/or difficult for me. I’m completing my third year of Korean, so I hope that helps a little. But overall, I’m just worried about getting there. I could get there, I’m sure I can pay the fare and get on the bus and get there. But then, what? So I think that’s what I need to research on. Hopefully, by having a smart phone, it would give me an easier time finding places. Those are the only reasons why I would find it to be difficult.\r\nS: Were you a Korean major before you entered college? \r\nN: I came in with a Korean major. I guess to give a little background. I looked a lot of other universities and I thought it would be more possible to go into East Asian studies, and I like that whole field of study in general. I don’t know why, I don’t know how to explain my deep interest in learning more about Korea, of course in terms of UCs, that’s why I didn’t find Santa Barbara, Berkeley, or San Diego. Because I knew I wanted to stick to East Asian and Korean field of study so I was looking more at UCLA and UCI, which was why I stuck with Korean. Because those schools really have a department and take interest in those fields and fund those fields. So that’s some of the reasons why. Lately, I’ve been deciding whether to change to East Asian, I guess it’s sort of my internal conflict or question I still have. Overall, I just hope that my interest and desire to learn would lead me to a career where I could stabilize myself and do what I enjoy with my major and be able to live comfortably, or even decently. I wouldn’t mind doing something with Korean and going somewhere that’s a little more desolate, or poor. \r\nS: You also mentioned that you had rehearsals for Korean Culture Night? \r\nN: Korean Culture Night in UCI was put on hold for a couple years back and it sort of came back again with my friend. She put it into works again and came back last year. In terms of me, I came about it because the acting coordinator was my friend. It was one of those things where, Hey you want to be part of Korean Culture Night? Yeah, sure. Would you be cool with a big part? You know, I hadn’t done acting in a while, and I would enjoy it. And so I wound up with one of the bigger roles and we just practiced and tried my best to fit it well. He asked me because that character is someone that kind of fits who I am. In terms of this year, it’s a new character, but I’m trying harder to learn my lessons last year and try to improve. \r\nS: You know how you said you were interested in K-pop… Did you get to go to any concerts?\r\nN: I enjoy listening to K-pop, but I’m not the kind of person that would want to go to a concert. But before Korea, I did go to the Korean Music Festival. \r\nS: What do you think is some of the differences between Koreans here in America and the Koreans you met in Korea?\r\nN: Koreans in America, then again, there are Koreans in America that you could say are essentially American, but there are also Koreans that seem to hold tighter to Korean way of acting, or they identify with what they deem to be a Korean image. I guess if we’re talking about Korean-Americans that I’m friends with, of course you get people who are more out-going. I’m just speaking in terms of my friends, but they’re very open about their perspective about things, like economy, politics, and society. Whereas, with Koreans in Korea, people that I met and are students my age, situations where they bring up opinions about politics and society, you don’t really get it unless the situation is more serious or in a more academic sense. Like, if I’m casually talking to someone, they wouldn’t bring it up unless I brought it up and then they would bring it up and they would be a lot more serious about how they perceive things. This is only based off of situations and people I met. Beside that, here, you get people who don’t really care about how they dress. When they have finals, they just put on sweats and t-shirt, whereas in Korea, you get a lot of people who—of course, looks really matter. You get a lot of people who just dress up, when you’re just going to go out to get some coffee. Or were going to go study. You get people here too, but I saw it more often there. In a case where I went to a food place, like Chili’s, and I was going to eat there with my friend, and I thought it was going to be more casual, but he had for some reason, a blazer on and I had a t-shirt and shorts. So I felt very out of place. That’s just a situation I remember. You get a lot of people who wear more make-up there, as in full-on, all over. Whereas, you’ve got my friends who just put on a little bit of stuff, and try to make it look not as much. I just know that B.B. cream is big. When I was in Korea, it gave me a chance to notice when a lot of people have more B.B. cream while I don’t really see it as much here. \r\nS: What would be considered small talk? How was your interaction with Koreans on a conversational level?\r\nN: When I first met Korean friends, it would be a very cliché image of what people would perceive to be a first conversation. How are you doing, what’s your major, are you in school, how’s your day. You don’t really get like, I don’t know how to compare it to something else, but it’s questions that they probably learned. Casual conversation-wise, in terms of me trying to talk to them like they were from America when they weren’t… Being like, Hey what’s up, what you doing? They’d give me answers that were a little more proper, Oh, I’m just at home. Or at work. Instead of, nothing much just chilling. You don’t really get stuff like that. You don’t get that very casual conversation come about.\r\nS: Did you drink there?\r\nN: Yeah\r\nS: So how was the drinking culture there?\r\nN: I will start by saying I was legal there. It’s amazing, really. I guess one of the things I would say was that when I was in the supermarkets, it was G.S. 25, I went to the alcohol section, they had Capri-sun pouched soju. And I was like, that’s crazy that they would have stuff like that. The way they promote their stuff, I thought, wow, they’re so ahead of what you would see in America. But then drinking culture wise, I found myself seeing less people drunk on the streets, because I wasn’t in those areas where I would see it more often. But in the movies and TV dramas, you always see those images of people drunk on the streets, or their friends trying to help them. But I didn’t really get to see it that much. I saw that a couple times in Pusan. But of course, drinking on a more casual basis, you drink pretty much anywhere. But I guess in terms of drinking with people you just met, or drinking with older people, I would say I felt more obligated to take the drink or drink it, because I didn’t want to be rude. And the whole, holding the cup like the mannerisms that come with drinking with people that are older than you. Drinking this way and not this way if I was with them. And taking it, and sort of not pushing them away by saying, I’m done. Just drinking. I only got drunk once or twice, because I didn’t really want to get into that. Because pretty much, that’s what everyone thinks of Korea. That’s also another image they have of Korea. You go there to drink. You go there to party, because that’s something that’s really fun to a lot of people’s eyes that I know. Drinking and partying is the biggest thing you can do in Korea, which is awesome, but that’s their perspective. I don’t really think that. \r\nS: You said you studied a lot before you went, or did research. So you learned about what was respectful and disrespectful. Did you find anything that you didn’t know was disrespectful and when you went there, you tried it out, you realized, yeah, never going to do that again.\r\nN: I don’t know if it’s disrespectful, but tipping. I didn’t know that you don’t tip people in Korea. When I learned about that before I went, I thought that was amazing. Something disrespectful I learned was, when you hand people money. It’s better to put your hand under the elbow. When I was doing that a lot in Korea, I had the habit of doing that here. It was so unconscious, I was unaware of doing it. I didn’t know it was impolite to eat all of the banchan before the food comes. I don’t know if people use that still now, but I just found that out. \r\nS: How did you learn about that?\r\nN: I don’t remember where. I just learned it online. For people who don’t use the Internet a lot, a fun really interactive source is Youtube, and especially “Eat Your Kimchi” which was created by this couple who have lived in Korea for about four or five years now. And they’re like foreigners that really try to educate people who want to come and give a perspective that Koreans can enjoy seeing. So they bring a lot of issues, like manners and stuff. I also learned a lot from friends and people I talked to and various websites. \r\n','Narith Ta.mp3','audio/mp3',48253306,1880830),(298,54,189,200,'ANIMALS IN KOREAN FOLKLORE--WONSUK CHOI',NULL,'SU, LUCHAO=S(ME)  CHOI, WONSUK=C(CONSULTANT)\r\nS: What animals will remind you of Korean folklore?\r\nC: Wow… hard question….Hmmm….\r\nS: hahaha... sorry, do you know some?\r\nC: Tigers?

Sorry, not really quite know about it. As for foxes, they are very popular in Korean, I think. But there are not a lot good symbolic meanings of the foxes. \r\nS: So… foxes are unlucky animal?\r\nC: Yes. There is a famous tale of the woman fox (gumiho) with nine tails. The gumiho always changes her shape and turns to a beautiful woman to try to eat men’s livers.

I’m going to interview my third interviewee – Scott. Scott is actually Sooyeon’s boyfriend, and Soo is our last interviewee. Let’s start with his personal information again. \r\nQ: What’s your birth date? \r\nA: I was born in May, 30th, 1988. I am 23. \r\nQ: Where did you come from? \r\nA: South Korea. Seoul. I came from same university as Sooyeon. I am an exchange student. \r\nQ: How do you know about White Day? \r\nA: I heard it from my friends about 10 or 11 years old. \r\nQ: When do you start celebrating it? \r\nA: I started to celebrate it when I was 14 or 15 maybe in middle school. \r\nQ: Did you have a girlfriend at the time? \r\nA: No, I just gave to anyone at the time. \r\nQ: Did you propose on White Day before? \r\nA: No. \r\nQ: Is White Day a big event in Korea? \r\nA:  Yea, it is. So, girls are expecting very much. \r\nQ: Do you think influence by drama a lot?  \r\nA: Sure. A lot. So drama makes many girls to expect huge gifts, also the drama makes the guys to spend more money on gifts. \r\nQ: Did your previous girlfriend really ask a big gift from you? \r\nA: Not really. But, I can feel it that she wants something. \r\nQ: Will you buy for her? \r\nA: I bought it, but not they wanted. \r\nQ: Do you think were they happy about it? \r\nA: If she wasn’t satisfied, then she was not my girlfriend. \r\nQ: Can you tell by her expression? \r\nA: If they were not happy even I gave something to her, I would be mad. Becuz I bought something. I did something, then you should be happy about it. \r\nQ: Do you really care about celebrating this kind of holiday? \r\n A: I don’t ignore it. But, I don’t really like kind of this. I will just buy some small gifts. \r\nQ: Some girls expect this, because if they receive, they would be very popular in school. How do you feel about it? Do you care about this feeling? \r\nA: I always hope that my girlfriend is not that type of person. \r\nQ: Do you think that your major (Economics) influence you? \r\nA: Nop. It’s my personality.

I have one older brother (2 yrs older; 21) who’s also pretty Americanized.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think living in K-town has had any impact/significant influence on how “Korean” you are?\r\nA: Valley Koreans aren’t as “Korean” as me. My mom raised me, but I only saw her when we were home. The majority of my life was outside of home (school, hagwŏn 학원, han\'gŭl hakkyo 한글학교)…I went to school in the valley for 9 years – starting 4th grade (4th-12th grade; at Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies). My mom didn’t want me going to Fairfax (K-town) because she thought I would become a kkangp’ae (깡패). \r\n\r\nQ: Do you feel more comfortable with Koreans?\r\nA: I guess I’m just more comfortable with Korean things because it’s my culture, but I don’t have this innate, deep sense of patriotism. There’s good things about Koreans, like the whole respect thing. But it’s bad too, like being super prideful: they think they’re good at everything, but actually suck at everything.\r\n\r\nQ: Where do you normally get your hair cut?\r\nA: I normally get my hair cut at mom’s friend’s place. Don’t remember the name of the place…\r\n\r\nQ: Who cuts your hair there? \r\nA: She’s this really young ajumma (아줌마) (30’s). My mom is 55 but my mom and the ajumma somehow know each other).\r\n\r\nQ: How long have you been going there?\r\nA: Been going there for around 3-4 years. Before, I went to a bunch of different places that my mom just took me to, just Korean mijangwŏn’s (미장원)… but I guess they didn’t really understand what I was saying because sometimes I would go places and they would just cut it however they wanted to.\r\n\r\n[Transition to direct transcription of recorded interview]\r\n\r\nI would ask them to cut it a certain way, but then they would never cut it the way that I asked them to. And I didn’t care that much – just ‘cause I don’t really care about stuff like that –but my brother was really picky, he’s really into waxing his hair and whatever, and so when they messed up his hair, which like every Korean place does, he was like “screw it, I don’t wanna come here,” but the place we go to now is pretty good at it, so now it’s okay.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think it’s because she’s younger?\r\nA: Umm, she’s from Korea, obviously. And in Korea she cut a lot of Korean celebrities’ hair and stuff, so she’s pretty good. Just the ajumma that we get our hair done from, though (not the other people at the mijangwŏn.)\r\n\r\nQ: Do you remember any specific times when they don’t do what you want them to do?\r\nA: Yes… I mean, I have long hair, and I was like “I wanna keep this long hair and I just want to cut it because it’s getting too chijŏbunhae,” (지저분해) and she’s like “ah, nae nae kŭrae\r\nkŭrae” (아 내내 그래 그래) and then it would turn into like… a sports cut.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What’s a sports cut?\r\nA: Like zzzzzzz [imitating sound of a hair trimmer’s buzzing sound]… or it would turn out really really weird and super short, but they wouldn’t use the zzz thing. And then it took a while to grow back, but once it did it was all chill\r\n\r\nQ: Are they usually ajumma’s that are cutting your hair?\r\nA: They’re not all old, but they’re not really young either. They’re not hip… I’m pretty sure they handled a lot of old people. \r\n\r\nQ: So usually females cut your hair?\r\nA: Mhm Mhm Mhm.\r\n\r\nQ: Have you ever gotten your hair cut by a man?\r\nA: Yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: Which one do you think is better?\r\nA: For my hair, probably a girl. ‘Cause guys, like the barbers, they just know how to shave off your head, I feel like. Unless they’re… gay.\r\n\r\nQ: What makes you always go to a Korean place then?\r\nA: When I was younger, it was just because my mom took me there, but then… funny story, very funny story:\r\n\r\nMy mom one day was like it’s really really cheap if you go to this place next to my work. It’s like 5 dollars. And I was like, “oh 5 dollars!” And she’s like  “I’ll give you the rest as yongton (용돈) if you go there.” So I was like, “alright” so I go there and there’s like this Hispanic place. But then I think that’s when my hair was like really good – and I was like “ooh I really wanna keep this hair” – and I go there and like… I should’ve known. They didn’t understand anything I said, but they were like, “haircut?” and I was like “yeah yeah yeah.” And I was telling them how I wanted it to be cut and they were like “si si si” and by the time it was done… it was so bad. And I think they only spoke Spanish. But yeah it was really bad… and I got really angry at my mom like “just ‘cause you want to save 5 bucks ŏmma (엄마) you ruined my hair!” And then… I went to a Korean place after that and they fixed it up – or they just cut it really really short – and then it grew back, and it was okay! I had a mushroom head… like a bowl cut LEGIT.\r\n\r\nQ: So when you go to the place you’ve been going to for a couple of years, what do you like about it?\r\nA: She cuts my hair well… \r\n\r\nQ: Do you feel comfortable? Like, have conversations?\r\nA: Mm yeah, we talk. She always says, “ooh chal saengyŏtnae” (잘생겼네)and I go “ooh ani ae yo” (아니에요) and then I blush. And then she’s like, “hakkyo ŏttŏni?” (학교 어떠니) and I’m like “ohh chowayo…” (좋아요) and then like, she always has cool hairstyles so then sometimes I’ll talk to her about that. I feel really comfortable with ajumma’s. So I’m able to talk to them.\r\n\r\nQ: So speaking in Korean is more comfortable for you?\r\nA: I guess.\r\n\r\nQ: Is speaking in Korean more comfortable than going to a place and speaking English to Americanized people?\r\nA: I guess… or I mean I would feel uncomfortable getting my hair cut at an American place. Just ‘cause I’ve gone to a Korean place all my life\r\n\r\nQ: Let’s say the other place was cheaper – you would still choose the Korean place?\r\nA: Mhm. Probably. \r\n\r\nQ: What have you done to your hair before? Do you always keep it long?\r\nA: I used to do sports cut (fobby way of saying it 스포츠커트), like zzzz, ‘cause I swam back in the day… but I was like really young. And then around 8th grade I started growing out my hair. And then, that was the point in time when I would go get a trim, and then not get a cut for like 6 months. So my hair would get really long, but it grew perfectly straight and beautiful. \r\n\r\nAnd then I would chop it all off, grow again, chop it all off… and a lot of it was because-like the reason I grew it out I had this skepticism like Koreans don’t know how to cut hair. But then I was still uncomfortable to go anywhere else. But then whenever I went, without fail, it would end up really weird looking, like a mullet and then like really short Korean thing. And I hated that. But it would grow out again, and then I’d get it cut again. And sometimes when I felt like it, I would cut it really really short and then just wax it… but then again I suck at waxing my hair so yeah… I prefer long hair. It’s more p‘yŏnhae (편해). But then if it’s too long it’s uncomfortable, so then I just go get a haircut.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think going to school in the valley had any influence on the type of hairstyle that you had?\r\nA: Nope. I just like the way I look with longer hair haha.\r\n\r\nQ: Have you ever dyed your hair?\r\nA: Nope-OH! When I was young. Like 4th grade I had the bumblebee bangs. You know what I’m talking about? Like the blonde, just streaks of blonde, just in the front. So freaking weird! My mom was just like, “oh igŏ hanbŏnhae bwara”, (이거 한번 해봐라) and I was like “what is it?” and she’s like “don’t worry about it” and she did it and I really didn’t like it, but whatever. \r\n\r\nQ: You did it at home?\r\nA: No, no at the Korean place, the mijangwŏn. Like while I got my hair cut. My brother and I got the same hair.\r\n\r\nQ: How did your friends/family react to it?\r\nA: My friends at school made fun of me. Just because they were all white. I don’t know. Korean ajumma’s liked it. I think it was the ‘in’ thing then. Like the H.O.T. days.\r\n\r\nQ: So, didn’t your other Korean friends have it?\r\nA: Well my school had like zero Koreans. There were 3 in my class, including me. My school was from 4th-12th grade in the Valley. I went to 3 graduations in one location—weird. \r\n\r\nQ: So you mentioned that they always lie to you anyway [at the salon]?\r\nA: No, no, no, it’s not that they lie, it’s just that… I don’t know if it’s that they lie and they do their own thing or that they don’t understand what I say. Actually, I don’t know why they didn’t… maybe it’s just that they’re incompetent. Like, they don’t know how to cut hair the way that I wanted it to be cut. Who knows?\r\n\r\nQ: So can you give me an example of a time like that?\r\nA: I never gave a specific amount, but I was just like “can you not cut it too short because I kinda wanna grow it out.” And they’re like, “oh, so you just want us to trim” and I’m like, “yeah! Trim’s a good definition” but then it wouldn’t be a trim, it’d be like… shave. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you ever voice your opinion?\r\nA: No. I mean, I look at it and I’m like “dang... they messed up… again.” But then I was always too respectful so I’d just be like “oh, kamsamneeda.” (감사합니다) If they say, “oh do you like it?” Then I’ll just kinda nod my head, but if they had nunch’i (눈치) I’m pretty sure they could see that I wasn’t being honest. But then—sometimes, the lady that I go to now, I really like it. Or Sometimes. Not really. I don’t know. Or I just don’t care anymore. \r\n\r\nPreviously, if I didn’t like it, then I wouldn’t be like “Oh yeah! I like it!” but then in my heart be like ‘I hate you.” \r\n\r\nQ: But you would still tip and come back again…?\r\nA: Well, there was a long time where I would just go to a lot of different places. Like, after they silp‘ae’d I would be just be like, “I’m never coming back here” and then go to a different place – silp‘ae, silp‘ae, silp‘ae (실패). \r\n\r\nSumin [his girlfriend] gave me a p’ama the other weekend, wanna see a picture?\r\nI was just at her house and she was bored. Doesn’t it look good? I really liked it. \r\n\r\nQ: So by p’ama you mean she curled your hair?\r\nA: Yeah. [explosion of laughter—interviewee embarrassed after accidentally exposing a self-taken picture of himself with the p’ama]\r\n\r\nQ: Did that make you want to get a real p’ama?\r\nA: Yeah. I was considering it. I’d probably never really do it. Cuz it’s gay. Because it’s not me.\r\nQ: But you said you really liked it.\r\nA: Yeah—it was funny. I took the picture cuz I sent it to her! Cuz when she did it her dad was watching and making fun of me, so I put my hood on when I left and when I got back home it was all poofy, like an ajumma p’ama.\r\n\r\nQ: Have any of your guy friends done p’amas before?\r\nA: No… little kids at my church. After Goo Joon Pyo came out.\r\n\r\nQ: And you didn’t want to do it at all?\r\nA: Am I being recorded right now…?\r\n\r\nQ: Are all the places you go to in K-town? Are they cheaper?\r\nA: Yeah.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you ever go outside of K-town?\r\nA: [coughing] No. Except for the Hispanic place. My mom works in Arcadia. \r\n\r\nQ: I guess, are there any other stories you can remember? It can be regarding anything.\r\nQ: Or when you go, do you ever go with friends?\r\nA: [laughing] No… that’s weird. \r\n\r\nQ: Oh, ‘cause Rachel said she goes with her friends.\r\nA: I guess that’s just a girl thing. I just go, get my haircut, and then, I leave. For a while, because like, all my white friends got their hair cut at like Super Cuts and barbershops and stuff, the idea of mijangwŏn was really foreign to them, they were like, “you get your hair cut by a girl?! That’s gay…” and like made fun of me and stuff. So I was like “ŏmma, I want to go get my hair cut by a namja!” and then… I just stopped caring after a while. \r\n\r\nQ: So you did try going to other places?\r\nA: Mhm. But that was like back in the day … middle school. And then I realized that barbershops, all they know how to do is shave you and buzz your hair. Or cut it like ajŏssi style. And I was like, “oh, this is not me.” So, yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: How do you feel about your hair now?\r\nA: Umm… I guess I stopped caring. But then I still like long hair better than short hair, ‘cause my hair is really thin and weak, so if its short, it doesn’t naturally go up like a lot of people’s. So then, that means that short hair looks really weird on me, unless I do something to it. But I don’t like doing things to it, ‘cause it takes too long. So I just grow out my hair.\r\n\r\nQ: Have you ever been to Korea?\r\nA: Nope. Nope.\r\n\r\nQ: Have any of your friends said anything to you about Korean salons in Korea?\r\nA: Mmm… the youth pastor at my church, her hair’s really weird—or it’s not weird, but it’s really short… like an awkward length. And she said it’s awkward because she went to Korea for a little bit and she did her hair there, but she messed up. And her hair got super jacked up, so she just chopped it all off. But then, there are other people who go and get super nice hairstyles.\r\n\r\nI feel like because K-town is like a little bit of Korea, you’ll find Korean artists and haircutters here, but the legit ones you’ll find in Korea because… it’s Korea. It’s just my opinion. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think Koreans are better at doing hair?\r\nA: Koreans are better at doing Korean hair. For both girls and guys…\r\n\r\nQ: How do you feel about girls with p’amas?\r\nA: What’s a p’ama? Like curly…?\r\n\r\nQ: Like, Emily recently got a p’ama.\r\nA: Ohh, dude so funny we were talking about it today. Like they noticed and they liked it. I guess, since Asians normally have black, flat hair, you know? So it’s like, I don’t really care about that stuff, but definitely because Asians have like the thin, whatever hair, if you do p’amas then it makes it look more, I don’t know what to call it, I don’t know the definitions, but voluminous I guess? I guess I could see why people would say it would look better. But I don’t really care about that kinda stuff.\r\n\r\nQ: What about for yourself, though? Since you said that you were contemplating it?\r\nA: Would I ever get a p’ama? It’s ‘cause my hair is really thin, and sometimes I’m scared that I’m balding or something, ‘cause like, it’s so thin that if I go like this to my hair I can see my scalp and I’m like, “nooo!” [gasp], but when I got the p’ama, I was like “wow, look at my hair! It’s so rich!”\r\n\r\nQ: Did your mom see it?\r\nA: Yeah—she liked it too. [giggles] She was like “get a p’ama”, but I was like “no.” And I was just joking around like “ŏmma, I’m gonna get a p’ama!” and she’s like “Next week!!” and I was like “noo I’m just kidding, what’s wrong with you?”\r\n\r\nQ: So to her, does price matter?\r\nA: I guess if it was too expensive then she would say no—especially since I’m a guy. P’amas don’t cost that much do they? I think if it was like a once in a lifetime kinda thing then she’d be okay with it. Like, she’s kinda different from other Korean moms in the sense that she’s not super frugal, if that’s a stereotype that I could draw on. Like, she spoils me a lot. She’ll buy me things... like if she sees that I really wanna get it, she’ll just get it for me regardless of the price. \r\n\r\nQ: Would you ever dye your hair or highlight it again?\r\nA: No. Maybe. For the lolz. Platinum blonde, you down? \r\n\r\nQ: P’ama or dying? Which ones more likely?\r\nA: Dying. \r\n\r\nQ: What color?\r\nA: Probably like, back in my punk rock days I wanted to do like dark blue. So that if it’s dark, I could just be like, yeah cool. But then like, maybe really really dark brownish red. \r\n\r\nQ: Would you say there’s a difference between the hairstyles you have and the hairstyles of fobs in America?\r\nA: Mhm. Well fobs have like the bowl cut. Fobs… just contrast my hair and Ik’s hair. ‘Cause he takes care of his hair and I just let it grow out. So yes, fobs care a lot.\r\n\r\nQ: Would you say it’s just with hair?\r\nA: I think it’s like, total bodies. Or appearance sort of thing. Like I said: Koreans are really good with the respect thing, but they’re really prideful and care so much about what others perceive them as, and then it definitely influences the way that they dress and their hair, etc… ','','',0,0),(301,32,165,231,'Korean-Americans and the Hair Salon','Fieldnotes','Q: Would you consider yourself a Korean-American? \r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Why? Can you tell me some of your background? \r\nA: I was born in San Francisco and I was raised in the suburb of Millbrae. My parents were divorced when I was 5—oh, my parents are both Korean. They came from Korea when they were in college and yeah. My Korean sucks. \r\n\r\nQ: So you always speak in English to your parents? \r\nA: It’s like, half and half. It’s very basic Korean, though, if I do speak in Korean. \r\n\r\nQ: So you’re most comfortable with… \r\nA: English. Yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: Where do you normally get your hair cut? \r\nA: I get my hair cut at—I don’t know what it’s called, it’s like Palace Beauty or something like that— Koreatown Plaza Mall. I’ve been going there ever since my second year, I think? So it’s been 3 years.\r\n\r\nQ: How did you find out about it? \r\nA: Well I was just at K-town Plaza with my mom, ‘cause she wanted to get groceries or something, and then there was a hair salon place there and my mom just told me to get my hair cut there. So I’ve just been going to the same ajumma (아줌마) for like, 3 years now. Yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you know her name? \r\nA: It’s like… Lo Hee? Like, R-o-h-e-e. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you call her that, though? \r\nA: No—I don’t really call her any title. I just say “annyŏng hasaeyo” (안녕하세요) and that’s it. \r\n\r\nQ: But when you go, how do they know that you want to get your hair cut by her? \r\nA: Oh, I just point at her… corner. Like, I don’t know, I can’t say her name. It’s like, “Rohee.” [has difficulty pronouncing the name]\r\n\r\nQ: But what about when you make an appointment?\r\nA: I never make an appointment. I just go in. ‘Cause I actually go in at like, 5-ish or something like that. And it’s always slow at that time. And there’s times when she’ll just be sleeping on her chair and I just kinda tap her… And just say “choesong hamnida, kŭnde mŏri cut haedŏ toeyo?” (죄송합니다 근데 머리 커트 해도되요?) like, “can I get a haircut right now?” and she’s always happy to see me. \r\n\r\nQ: Does she know you by name? \r\nA: I don’t know if she does… I think she does? Like, she knows who I am, for sure. ‘Cause I’ve been going there for a long time now... Like, 3 years. \r\n\r\nQ: So you feel pretty comfortable with her?\r\nA: Yeah. She can’t speak English very well though. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you guys have conversations? \r\nA: Uh, it’s like very basic. Like, I’m pretty quiet since I can’t communicate in Korean very well. So once in a while she’ll just make comments or ask me questions, like do I miss my mom or stuff like that. Or, she’ll always be like, “oh do you have a girlfriend”… yeah, she’ll just joke around about stuff like that.\r\n\r\nQ: And what’s your response? \r\nA: Just like, “oh, ŏpsŏyo” (없어요) and she’ll be like “ah, chal saengyŏt neun dae, woe ŏpsŏ?” (잘 생겼는데 왜 없어?) yeah… and I don’t know what to say to that, so it’s just awkward like “ani ae yo” (아니에요). I don’t know what to say to that. So yeah, that’s the typical conversation. I think she brings it up like every single time I go.\r\n\r\nQ: How often do you get a haircut? \r\nA: I would say around once every two months? It’s just… I should be cutting it like once a month but I’m too lazy to go all the way over there that often. \r\n\r\nQ: Is it usually just a basic cut?\r\nA: Yeah it’s just, basic. Or one time I got straight p’ama (파마), but yea… that was a pretty regretful decision in my life. \r\n\r\nQ: That was the same ajumma? How did she convince you to do it? \r\nA: Yeah. She didn’t… convince me. My mom went with me once and was like, “do you want to get a p’ama or anything?” And I was like, “No?” And I don’t know… I’m a pretty spontaneous guy, so one time I went by myself, and I had just watched Secret Garden. And you know how Hyun Bin has a straight p’ama in that drama, so I was like “you know what, whatever. I might as well give it a try. Who cares” so I tried it. And I told her. And she was kinda surprised. \r\n\r\nQ: Was it expensive? \r\nA: I don’t remember how much it was… I think it was like 100 bucks? Maybe $120 I don’t know. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you remember anything she said about it? \r\nA: No—I don’t remember anything like that, sorry. I just remember the machine behind me heating my hair and she gave me a Korean magazine, which I could not read. It was like a… women’s magazine. Like, Ceci or whatever it’s called. \r\n\r\nQ: What about when the straight p’ama was done?\r\nA: Like, I looked in the mirror and I was like, “what the freak….” ‘Cause I’ve never seen myself with that type of… haircut. So it was kinda shocking to see myself like that.\r\n\r\nQ: Be honest… did you like it? \r\nA: I mean it was okay, I guess. It was weird though. I mean I can’t really say if I liked it or not because it was whatevers. I don’t think the ajumma said anything bad though…\r\n\r\nQ: What about when she asks like, “oh, how do you like it?” \r\nA: I don’t think she ever asked me that. Yeah… even when I normally get my hair cut. Like she just says “Oh, kkŭt nassuyo!” (끝났어요) and I’m like “okay.”\r\n\r\nQ: Do you ever leave dissatisfied?\r\nA: No. It’s just the same haircut every time. I guess I don’t really care as long as it looks… okay. I’m not really picky about that kinda stuff. \r\n\r\nQ: Where did you normally get your haircut back at home?\r\nA: I always got it at this little hair salon in Millbrae. \r\n\r\nQ: Was it Korean also? \r\nA: Yeah, it was Korean. I’ve been to different places. Like every 4 years, maybe, I’d switch. But they were all Korean. I’d try going to American ones a few times at UCLA. Like the one in Westwood, the one that everyone goes to? Oak… Oakley’s? Is it Oakley’s? I’m blanking out, but I went there a few times. It was okay. I don’t know why I just didn’t go there actually… I just like supporting the Korean business I guess. Since I’m racist. [laughter]\r\n\r\nQ:  But did you feel more comfortable at a place like Oakley’s?\r\nA: It was cool ‘cause like, the guy would just talk to me, I guess? And it wasn’t awkward… at all. Or, it was probably less awkward at the American place, but I still went to the Korean one. ‘Cause I would kinda use it as an excuse to come to K-town and eat lunch or dinner over there. \r\n\r\nQ: So do you usually go with a friend? \r\nA: No—I just go by myself. And yeah… eat by myself. Once in a while with a friend, but usually by myself. \r\n\r\nQ: Before college did you ever try going to an American place? \r\nA: No. Never. Oh actually, I went once! It was like an old school barbershop and I just got a buzz cut there. I think that’s why I went there. It was cheap. \r\n\r\nQ: How much is it normally when you go to a Korean place? \r\nA: 20 bucks. Plus $5 tip. Pretty cheap.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think you go for the price? \r\nA: I don’t know. Well, my mom just tells me to pay for it. And I’m like, alright. Oakley’s was really cheap though, that place was like 12 bucks. \r\n\r\nQ: So why didn’t you ever go back? \r\nA: To support Korean business. And to eat K-town food.\r\n\r\nQ: So as a Korean-American, is it kind of like, your duty? \r\nA: I wouldn’t say duty, it’s just because my family always tried to support the Korean-American community, so I just kinda do the same too. \r\n\r\n[Break; Parking the car and transitioning from inside the car to waiting outside of the restaurant.]\r\n\r\nQ: Do you have any notable hairstyles you remember of your entire life? \r\nA: Middle school I colored my hair brown. And in 6th grade, I spiked my hair back then, the front, with gel—I colored it, like burgundy or something like that. And the sun hit it, so then it turned pink. So if you look at my 6th grade yearbook picture, my hair’s like… pink. [laughs]\r\n\r\nQ: Did you get it done professionally? \r\nA: It was in Korea—got it done in Korea. And the brown color, I got it done in the summer, too.\r\n\r\nQ: So did you visit Korea often? \r\nA: I think I went every summer in middle school with my mom. Baller? I’m an only child. \r\n\r\nI remember when I colored my hair brown, they put white stuff in my hair. So my hair was all white and I was like, “dude, this better not be what it looks like after.” And that’s all I remember. And I went to a Korean salon recently, like I went to Korea this past summer, and I just went to a random one. ‘Cause I just wanted to get my hair cut before I came back to America. And it was quite an experience, ‘cause, they wash your hair for five minutes, and massage it, and like, hot towel over your eyes and everything. And I was just like, “dude, this is nice.”\r\n\r\nQ: And it’s around the same price range as here? \r\nA: It was imanwŏn (이만원), so like, 20 bucks. And you don’t give tip in Korea. I gave them tip and they were like, “what the heck.” Like, “oh, it’s okay,” but I just kinda gave it to them. It was fun though, because they were just asking me about America and stuff. \r\n\r\nQ: How did they know you were American? \r\nA: I told them I was from America and they could tell from my crappy Korean. They would like, keep asking me how to say things in English and I was just entertaining them, I guess. And she was pretty young. It was two girls—one was the assistant and one was just the main person. Yeah, I don’t know. That’s it.\r\n\r\nQ: When you got your hair done in middle school, was it because someone recommended it? \r\nA: Oh, it was ‘cause it was the ‘fad’ at the time, because all of those K-pop groups at the time like H.O.T., G.O.D, and stuff. So everyone got their hair colored. \r\n\r\nQ: So you wanted to do it? \r\nA: Yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you ask your mom? \r\nA: Yeah, I did. I remember. \r\n\r\nQ: What happened when you came back to the U.S.? \r\nA: I don’t remember if there was a response… I don’t think there was though. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you have any white friends, who I don’t know, thought it was weird? \r\nA: No, they were all Asian. All my friends did it though. It was the cool thing to do. And like, the silver necklace and, I don’t remember what else. Oh, the white hoodie sweatshirt, and baggy jeans. \r\n\r\nQ: Was it just middle school that most of your friends were Asian?\r\nA: I guess it was… I had some white friends, but I don’t think they said anything about it. But all the Asians were Asian American, too. I didn’t hang out with fobs. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think there’s a distinguishing factor between you and the fobs in your style? \r\nA: Right now? Yeah. Because they care way more about their appearance I feel like, And they get those crazy hair styles and dress really nicely. Like, p’amas and I don’t know. I remember I talked to my cousin about hairstyles and she would tell me that guys spend like 30 minutes doing their hair in Korea. They wax, and then gel, and then blow-dry it, and then do all this other stuff. I blow-dry my hair for about 15 seconds and that’s about it.\r\n\r\nQ: And why do you think you can’t spend that much time?\r\nA: I don’t think it’s worth it.\r\n\r\nQ: Since you’re going to live in Korea, do you think that’s going to change? \r\nA: No, I still don’t think it’s going to be worth it. I’ll probably dress more nicely, but I think that’s it. I don’t know, we’ll see. Maybe I’ll get a p’ama or something.

Umm… I was born in L.A. and then I grew up in Washington. My mom is fluent in English and she’s the one that raised me, so I would consider myself a Korean-American. But I’m also fluent in Korean and in touch with my cultural background.\r\n\r\nQ: What about your dad? \r\nA: My dad? Oh you know…[laughs] he’s not that good at English, but he’s I guess, still fluent. Hangs out with a lot of American speaking people… or a lot of his customers.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think that has an impact on the way you were raised, opposed to having fobbier parents? \r\nA: Yeah, well, since my mom got remarried to my stepdad, who’s really Korean cultured, it’s really different. He’s definitely more about respect and very… prideful. So it’s different. My mom was still strict, but my stepdad is super strict and not lenient. \r\n\r\nQ: What about your dad?  \r\nA: Even though my dad is pretty Korean-cultured, he trusts me a lot and treats me like his princess… and he doesn’t care. He lets me do whatever I want. Yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: What language do you speak to your parents? \r\nA: I talk to my mom and stepdad in English and talk to my dad and stepmom in Korean. \r\n\r\nQ: How long did you live in Washington? \r\nA: From 2-15? 14? So, around 12-13 years. And since then I’ve been living in K-town.\r\n\r\nQ: What were the demographics of where you lived? \r\nA: So I lived in suburbs for most of my life. I lived in pretty nice neighborhoods and once my mom got remarried, I moved to Bellevue with my stepdad. That’s like one of the richest cities in the world… that’s like right where Bill Gates lives. And it was a huge culture shock after moving to K-town where it was actually one of the poorest schools I’ve ever seen in my life. Like, 90% Hispanic. \r\n\r\nQ: What were your schools like then? Were there Asians and Koreans? \r\nA: Yeah, not a lot though. In Washington it was purely white. We had like two black people and they were both there for football. And then in LA it was mostly Hispanics, Filipinos and Asians. Koreans…\r\n\r\nQ: Were there Korean businesses in Washington where you lived? \r\nA: Yeah. There were. It’s not like there weren’t any Koreans, it’s just that Koreans didn’t live in Bellevue. Not many…\r\n\r\nQ: Do you remember where you used to get your hair cut when you lived in Washington? \r\nA: Yeah, I forget the name of it but it’s my friend’s dad’s hair salon. And it’s pretty well known, pretty big. Yeah, it’s Korean. It wasn’t in Bellevue, but it was in Federal Way, where I lived before my mom got remarried. It’s like a 40-minute drive. \r\n\r\nQ: So you’d drive 40 minutes every time you went to get your hair done? \r\nA: Yeah—but I wouldn’t get my hair done that often. Like, maybe once every year or once every 6 months?\r\n\r\nQ: What about your siblings then, did they go there too? \r\nA: Yeah. Or they would go to other places too, but I don’t remember. I wouldn’t go with them.\r\n\r\nQ: Did you like it there?\r\nA: Yeah, I liked everyone there. There were really good at doing hair and I was really comfortable with them. \r\n\r\nQ: So it was a family friend? \r\nA: Yeah—I went to middle school with her and her dad knew my mom. So he would do my mom’s hair too. \r\n\r\nQ: And did you speak in Korean to him? \r\nA: Yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: Are you equally comfortable with both languages?\r\nA: Um, well I’m better at English, but I’m still comfortable with Korean. I would feel awkward talking to them in English… just because their first language is Korean. And I don’t know, it’s just more respectable I guess… to talk to them in Korean?\r\n\r\nQ: Do you talk to them in chondaetmal (존댓말) then? \r\nA: Yeah. [Very affirmative] Insa (인사) when I see them and then talk to them in chondaetmal. \r\n\r\nQ: So it was a man that cut your hair? \r\nA: There were different people, but I didn’t mind. The owner, he’s a guy, but the rest are girls.\r\n\r\nQ: Would you talk to them? \r\nA: Yeah—insa, and they’d be like, “oh hi! Soyŏn-i!” (소연이) and then I’d just tell them what I wanna do. Sometimes I’d take pictures of what kinda hairstyle I would want to give to them. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you ever have trouble describing it to them? \r\nA: Umm… not really. I never did anything super complicated or crazy. \r\n\r\nQ: And what would the result be? \r\nA: Usually when I would get my bangs cut, it’s always awkward the first few weeks. And since I wasn’t used to it, it’s not like I was like “ooh I love it!” but it was never… really bad. \r\n\r\nQ: Was it because they didn’t do what you wanted, or just because? \r\nA: I think, just because. Like, when you first cut your bangs, I think it’s always going to be weird and be like that. It doesn’t look natural because it’s more straight. \r\n\r\nQ: Would they ever ask you in the end, “ooh, do you like it?” \r\nA: Yeah, and I would always say I did, even if I didn’t. [laughs] \r\n\r\nQ: Why? \r\nA: I don’t know. I just… I think it’s just rude. \r\n\r\nQ: But don’t some places give a free cut or something if you don’t like it? \r\nA: Yeah… but I don’t like doing stuff like that. Yeah I don’t know… I think that’s just my personality. \r\n\r\nQ: What about now that you live in K-town? Where do you get it done? \r\nA: My aunt, she cuts my hair. She used to work at a hair salon place but after she was pregnant, she stopped working. So now I just go to her house and she does my hair; she does my brother’s hair, too. \r\n\r\nQ: How far is it? \r\nA: Oh, they live like 5 blocks away from me. So I just walk there or they just pick me up. \r\n\r\nQ: So you feel really comfortable? \r\nA: Yeah, I feel super comfortable with them. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you pay at all?  \r\nA: Haha no. But I always babysit my cousins, so yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: What have you done to your hair before? \r\nA: When I was in 6th grade I cut my hair kinda short, to my shoulder length, and then I bleached it. I don’t know why, it was the ugliest thing ever. I don’t know what I was thinking. It was just strips of yellow, blonde hair. And then in 9th grade I dyed my hair really brown—like light light light brown, almost yellow. And everyone thought I was a fob because I did that. And then, after that, the most extreme thing I did was this past summer when I cut like 14 inches of my hair off… and I cried. [laughs] I was soo sad! \r\n\r\nQ: So did you regret it? \r\nA: Well, yeah! I told the ajumma (아줌마) to cut it to my shoulder and she cut it to my… chin. My neck. So yeah, I didn’t go to my aunt’s that time. Just went to this place across the street from my house. A Korean place. I just went there ‘cause my brother would go there sometimes when my aunt was busy. \r\n\r\nQ: Was it cheap? \r\nA: Yeah. It’s pretty cheap. \r\n\r\nQ: Did she say anything when you started crying? \r\nA: Oh, I didn’t cry in front of her. [laughs] I cried at home and my brother’s like, “Why are you crying?!” and I’m like “I don’t know!” So embarrassing [laughing]\r\n\r\nQ: Have you ever wanted to go to an American place at all?\r\nA: No, not really. Just because… yeah. And usually I go with my parents so they would take me to a Korean place. Yeah… I’ve never been to and I’ve never minded…\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think there’s a difference when you get your hair cut by an ajumma or an ajŏssi (아저씨)?\r\nA: Mmm… not really. But actually, I think a difference between Korean owned salons and American salons, Korean salons sometimes they don’t do what you ask for, they do what they think will look best. And they don’t really care—especially if you’re a kid. \r\n\r\nQ: And what do you think American salons do? \r\nA: I think they do what you tell them to do… they listen to you. \r\n\r\nQ: But you still would just go to a Korean...? \r\nA: Yeah, I guess. I don’t know. [laughs] I think American places are more expensive, too. Actually, well the better ones. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think there’s a difference between your hairstyles and the hairstyles of a fob who lives in the U.S.? \r\nA: Yeah. A lot of the fobs have the front bangs, like, the bowl cut looking thing. And then the guys have longer hair, which most bananas won’t have. And some guys even have p’ama (파마), too.\r\n\r\nQ: Would you ever let your brother do that? \r\nA: P’ama? No. Well my brother has kkopsŭl mŏri (꼽슬 머리) anyway, but I would never let him do that. \r\n\r\nQ: Why? \r\nA: Because… I don’t know. Uhh… I don’t know. I don’t think he would look good. \r\n\r\nQ: What if he wanted to bleach it? \r\nA: No way! No. I would never let him. Too gay… \r\n','','',0,0),(303,59,271,230,'Scott Song Interview White Day 3 Part II ','Audio','Q: Do you think that your major (Economics) influence you? \r\nA: Nop. It’s my personality. I want some humble people. \r\nQ: If you receive some fancy stuff from your girlfriend, will you buy her same value stuff for her on White Day? \r\nA: yea. I will try to give her some nice things. \r\nQ:  Will you buy her a similar value gifts? \r\nA: I don’t really care about money value. I care more about the deep feeling, not the expensive one, but meaningful and valuable gifts.  \r\nQ: Will you feel one gender benefit more?  \r\nA: Yes. Girls already always benefit more. On White Day, guys do not only give candies, guys tend to buy more like some chocolate and more valuable stuff. Guys really spend a lot. \r\nQ: Do you think the girls do the same also? \r\nA: If you see the Korean advertisements for Valentines’ Day and White Day, there are so many chocolate advertisements on Valentines’ Day, but there are so many advertisements for some other stuff on White Day. The advertisements on White Day are not only about candies. \r\nQ: Do you like to watch Japanese drama in Korea? \r\nA: Yea, I did one time.  \r\nQ: Is that very popular in Korea? \r\nA: No. It is actually totally different from Korean drama, so many people not used to it. \r\nQ: Do you know why Korean culture has White Day? \r\nA: Because girls want to get something back. \r\nQ: Actually, we have the White Day. We know about the White Day from Japanese and Japanese drama. \r\nA: Not now. But, we were. \r\nQ: Now White Day is part of Korean culture? \r\nA: we all know that White Day comes from Japan. But, now we don’t care about it and we celebrate it as our own way. \r\nQ: Do you have any ideal celebration about White Day? \r\nA: Not really. In my opinions, White Day is a just commercial day. I don’t want to do any special things on White Day. \r\nQ: Even though your girlfriend wants something, don’t you still celebrate it? \r\nA: I do special things on her birthday and anniversary, but not really on White Day. \r\nQ: Do you have any other comments that we talked about last time, but we haven’t talked about this time?  \r\nA: I like American Valentines’ more than Korean Valentines’ and White Days, the separate system. In America, you can give your girlfriends whatever you like since you do not really know what the girls are going to give to you. But, in Korea, you already knew it, so you should give more than what you got. That’s unfair. And also, exchanging gifts is more interesting and more surprised. \r\nQ:  Why do you think Korean guys tend to buy more expensive products for girlfriends? \r\nA: Because of girls’ expectation. \r\nQ: Will you feel better if you buy more expensive gifts to your girlfriend? \r\nA: No. I don’t really care. \r\nQ: How about in general? I know in general, guys tend to buy more expensive stuff? \r\nA: If it is not my girlfriend, it’s ok. I feel if buy something that is what I want to, I want to make her happy. I don’t care about the money value. \r\nQ: Why do you think the guys do that? Because of their face? \r\nA: Yea. Or, Korean girls actually expect a lot. If some guys want to keep a girlfriend for a long time and propose to a girlfriend, they tend to buy more expensive stuff to satisfy them.  \r\n','Scott Song Interview Part II.m4a','audio/x-m4a',2889527,1883040),(304,32,166,234,'Korean-Americans and the Hair Salon','Audio','Q: Would you consider yourself a Korean-American?\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Why? Can you tell me about some of your family background?\r\nA: I was born in the U.S. but both of my parents were born in Korea and immigrated to the U.S. when they were pretty young. \r\n\r\nQ: So would you describe your upbringing as pretty Korean, Americanized, or a combination?\r\nA: Probably a combination of both because both sets of my grandparents lived here pretty close to me when I was growing up, so I always had be able to speak Korean to be able to speak to my grandparents but I speak to my parents in Korean because they can understand.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you feel equally comfortable with both languages?\r\nA: I’m definitely more comfortable with English, but I don’t think my Korean is that bad. Like, I can get by pretty well.\r\n\r\nQ: So when do you have to speak Korean?\r\nA: Usually when I’m talking to my grandparents or when I run into Korean adults that my parents know, I try to talk to them in Korean unless I really can’t convey what I have to say in Korean, then I have to, um, mix half and half.\r\n\r\nQ: Does that mean all these adults can only speak Korean?\r\nA: No—some of them can speak English but I feel uncomfortable talking to them in English sometimes because it seems disrespectful somehow…\r\n\r\nQ: Okay. Is that something your parents have instilled in you?\r\nA: No it just seems wrong to speak English to a Korean adult if their first language is Korean… I don’t know why… or maybe because… maybe it is something my parents have instilled in me. It just seems disrespectful. \r\n\r\nQ: What were most of your friends like? Would you say you’ve been surrounded by a Korean-American community where you lived?\r\nA: Yeah—I grew up in NorCal in San Jose so there’s a pretty sizeable Korean-American community in the San Francisco, Bay Area. And I always had a lot of Korean-American friends who grew up in like a similar upbringing and family environment. \r\n\r\nQ: But you guys would speak in what language to each other?\r\nA: Oh, we would always speak in English. We’d only speak in Korean if we were like joking around. Pretty much all of my schooling. I think I only spoke to kids in Korean, like when I was a baby. Like when I was first learning how to talk.\r\n\r\nQ: Where do you normally get your hair cut?\r\nA: For the past couple years I’ve been going to an American salon near my house. It’s call Faux, like faux fur, f-a-u-x.\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, do you like it there?\r\nA: Yeah, I actually do like it a lot. \r\n\r\nQ: What brought you there?\r\nA: Well- a couple of my friends from high school used to get their hair cut there and I really liked the way that it came out and I was unhappy with the way my haircuts would turn out. And I would always go to Korean salons like with my sister and my mom. And it just felt like they didn’t understand what I wanted or my hair would just turn out too fobby, or too many layers and I just didn’t like the style of it, and I couldn’t really tell the hairdresser how exactly I wanted it. So I decided to just switch... and I never really went back.\r\n\r\nQ: What do you mean by ‘too fobby’ though?\r\nA: Like they’d always have these magazines, like Korean or Japanese and like, it would match the models, but I just felt like it would look really weird on me, living in America… like the hairstyles were really different\r\n\r\nQ: So, would that be the hairstyle that would come out in the end?\r\nA: Yeah, it would stick pretty close to the magazine, which would end up looking weird on me. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: So how did you feel?\r\nA: Uh, I was never really that satisfied, but I would always lie and say that I liked it, even though my face obviously said that I did not. \r\n\r\nQ: What would you say then?\r\nA: I’d be just be like “ne, chohahaeyo.. ha ha” (네, 좋아해요.. 하하)…and leave… well my mom would pay, but yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: Before Faux, do you remember any of the places you went to?\r\nA: I remember going to a Korean salon when I was really young and getting a p’ama (파마), but I was too young to really care what my hair looked like. I’m pretty sure I was just getting a p’ama ‘cause my mom wanted me to get a p’ama… and then my next hair memory is probably like, either middle school or like freshmen year of high school I went to this one Korean lady, but she actually had like this junior stylist named Cindy who cut my hair. And I actually liked how she cut my hair, but she would just take way too long, so I just stopped going to her and went to a couple other Korean salons in the area, but my Korean wasn’t very good, especially when it comes to hair terms, ‘cause like I would only get my hair cut every couple months, so it’s not like I would know all the “hair terminology” so I would just go and be like “ohh, can I get a trim? Can you cut my bangs?”\r\n\r\nQ: In English?\r\nA: Oh no… I would be like “oh, mŏri charŭgo sip‘ŏyo… uh, irŏtke haeju saeyo” (오,머리 자르고 싶어요… 이렇게 해주세요) like in the magazine, try to find one that I think would be not quite so fobby, and like look okay on me. But I would always end up being like, super fob.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: So why do you think you always went to these Korean places?\r\nA: ‘Cause my mom went to Korean salons and usually my mom or my dad would take me, ‘cause I couldn’t drive for a while. And then, I just always went to a Korean salon, so that was just what I was used to, too.\r\n\r\nQ:  So it was just about following your parents wherever they went?\r\nA: Pretty much. And like, everyone knew that American salons were a little bit more expensive, so a lot of the time if you went to a Korean salon, my parents would know them so they would maybe give us a discount or something.\r\n\r\nQ: Was that the case with any of the places you went to?\r\nA: Uh, I think we did get a discount at a couple of the places, just because of mutual friends or something like that? \r\n\r\nQ: So who cuts your hair now that you go to Faux?\r\nA: Um, my old hairstylist who used to cut my hair there actually moved to Oakland, but I decided not to follow her because it’s too far to drive an hour away just to get my hair done… so it’s this other girl named Tracy.\r\n\r\nQ: Why do you like getting your hair cut by Tracy?\r\nA: Uh because it’s easier for me to reference what kinda hair style I want. Because if I mention a celebrity, maybe, or someone that I saw on TV or bring in a picture, she’ll know what I’m talking about. So it’s a lot easier for me to explain what kinda hairstyle I want, in like, way fewer words. \r\n\r\nQ: But you could do the same thing couldn’t you? At a Korean place… just bring in a picture?\r\nA: That’s true… but for some reason I never thought about bringing in a picture of a white girl into a Korean salon.   \r\n\r\nQ: You mentioned that American salons are more expensive… is that the case with where you go now?\r\nA: Yeah it is more expensive, but I don’t think it’s necessarily because it’s American. Because obviously there’s different levels of salons. But every time I’ve gone, I’ve been almost 100% satisfied with my hair. Like, maybe not the styling, but with the cut, almost every time I’ve liked it. And so, that’s why I kept on going back.\r\n\r\nQ: So even if you go to an American place, do you feel more comfortable with communication?\r\nA: Yeah, communication-wise it’s a lot more comfortable. \r\n\r\nQ: But you said even if they style it badly, your response is still….\r\nA: I still kinda nod and say yes. I mean there have been a couple times where they style it and I actually like it, but other times, they styled it and I was just kinda like [squirming noise] but I just say yes anyway ‘cause I just feel bad telling them that I don’t like it.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think that has anything to do with being Korean?\r\nA: I think a lot of people usually do that because they feel bad…\r\n\r\nQ: So the place is more expensive than the Korean places before?\r\nA: Yeah—it’s actually a lot more expensive than the other places I’ve gone to. It’s probably about $20 more expensive. \r\n\r\nQ: Why do you think you’ve stuck with it then?\r\nA: I actually tried to go to a couple different salons before, so I tried to look for a couple placers that were cheaper that would give me the same quality of cut (American places), but I just never really liked it that much, so it’s kinda my fall-back now because if I go I know that I’ll like the haircut I get. \r\n\r\nQ: And you’ve only done cuts there?\r\nA: Yeah, only cuts. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think you’ve been able to have that relationship more because you’re able to communicate?\r\nA: Well, I don’t know about relationship, like I know they remember me, like they know who I am, but at the same time, they don’t really remember what our conversation was… so a lot of the time, we end up talking about the same thing we talked about last time… or it’s just like, light, chit chat kind of things like “oh~ how as your weekend, what are you doing, bla bla bla.” Like my hairstylist before was really into horoscopes and your sign and things like that so she would always ask me when my birthday was and tell me to read this book to see what that meant [laughing].  \r\n\r\nQ: So it’s not really like the movie portrayal…\r\nA: Yeah—it’s not like the fun gay guy who knows everything about my life and then we gossip about everything.\r\n\r\nQ: What have you done to your hair in the past?\r\nA: Umm… I got a p’ama when I was really young, like 4 or 5 or something like that. And then I’ve always had my hair about medium length, ‘cause I could never wait for it to grow out long enough. And finally when I got my hair to grow out longer, I actually got another p’ama a couple of years ago. And I actually did that at a Korean salon because I knew that it was gonna be expensive at an American salon and because Korean people get p’amas so often, I just thought their “p’ama technology” would be better or something. And then, uh recently in the summer when I went to Korea for my first time, I got my hair cut and dyed. \r\n\r\nQ: Oh—how did you like it?\r\nA: I actually liked it… a lot. But it was super fobby… I actually liked it a lot when I was in Korea but once I got back to the U.S. everyone was telling me how much of a fob I looked like so then I was kinda like “meh” but I still liked it. \r\n\r\nQ: So the reaction was like, “Oh, it’s so fobby, it’s bad?”\r\nA: Well, I don’t think any of my friends or anyone I knew had the heart to tell me that it looked bad even if it did, but for the most part the reactions were either good and just, “you look super fobby.”\r\n\r\nQ: What do you think are the implications of “fobby”?\r\nA: It’s like, people in Korea, they have a different sense of style and beauty, I guess… than the U.S. I mean obviously, the U.S. has influenced Asia and what not a lot, but it’s still a very different aesthetic. So, like, Korean people these days are really into having like a mushroom cut or bowl cut kind of thing… like short hair, blunt bangs, and having like… almost everyone has their hair dyed to a very light brownish. Whereas everyone in the U.S. has like is about making it look sort of natural coloring? And your hair is… I feel like long hair is always pretty popular in the U.S. \r\n\r\nQ: And it’s not like that in the U.S.?\r\nA: No, it is. But it’s like, I don’t know. The styles are just different. Like, you don’t really hear of white girls getting a perm ‘cause most of them already have naturally wavy hair.\r\n\r\nQ: So you’ve gotten like 2 or 3 p’amas?\r\nA: I think it’s 2…\r\n\r\nQ: So what do you think it is about girl or Korean guys and p’amas? I feel like it’s such a common thing.\r\nA: I think it’s ‘cause, not that many Korean people have naturally curly hair, and even those who do, it’s not the same kinda curls as white people who have curtly hair because Asian people have much thicker hair and more wiry. It’s like, you want what you can’t have… like people who have curly hair always want to get their hair straightened out and people who have straight hair always want waves. \r\n\r\nQ: How did you like your p’ama experience?\r\nA: Um, well I looked like an idiot while I was doing it. I liked having the p’ama when I had it? It was like super tightly curled in the beginning so I didn’t like it, but once it loosened out a lot more I liked it ‘cause I just had my hair wavy and it was easy to take care of ‘cause I would just blow-dry real quick and it would look like I had my hair done. \r\n\r\nQ: And where did you get this p’ama?\r\nA: At a Korean salon back at home. It was actually when I stopped going to Korean salons so I just went there to get the p’ama. I don’t even know if they have perms… I’ve never heard of a white person getting a perm. Yeah, ‘cause everyone was talking about this new thing called “digital p’ama” that was supposed to be more wavier, and less of tight curls. \r\n\r\nQ: When you used to go to Korean salons, who would be cutting your hair?\r\nA: Umm, I don’t remember the name, but it was just this Korean lady, kinda like late 30’s early 40’s age ish. I mean I guess she was an ajumma (아줌마), I don’t know if she’s married or has kids, but she’s definitely a lot older than me…\r\n\r\nQ: So are you guys talking while she’s doing your hair?\r\nA: Not really… [laughs] Well, because I wasn’t really that comfortable talking to her and I’m kinda an awkward person anyway. \r\n\r\nQ: So it has to do more with language and personality, not really anything to do with like…\r\nA: Yeah…\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think you’ll ever go back to a Korean salon?\r\nA: I feel like I’m gonna stick with Faux… just ‘cause, if I compare before when I would go to Korean salons and after now, I have a lot more positive experiences with going to the American salon. \r\n\r\nQ: Yeah, but you said you were pretty satisfied with your cut in Korea?\r\nA: Yeah, but I think it’s ‘cause I was in Korea. ‘Cause I remember when I was first in Korea the way my hair was, as it was in the US, everyone would stare at me because I wouldn’t fit in with everyone else. But I was in Korea for about a month, and that’s kinda a long time, so I could tell that I didn’t fit in. Bu then once I got my haircut, ‘cause like I actually got 2 haircuts in Korea. The first one I really didn’t like, so that’s why I ended up cutting it shorter and dying it… yeah once I go the more typical looking Korean cut, I guess the more fobby looking cut, no one would stare at me anymore because I guess I just blended in more. \r\n\r\nQ: And you liked that once better?\r\nA: Well I liked it better than the haircut before but I kinda wish I didn’t cut my hair at all. Yeah—I would’ve been okay with keeping my hair the way it was, but the only thing was that my hair was so long, that it was just really hot because it was so humid. But, now that I think about it I kinda regret cutting my hair at all… like I wish I didn’t cut it.  \r\n\r\nQ: But that’s the you that’s back in the U.S. now, right?\r\nA: Yeah. Or if I didn’t cut my hair, I kinda feel like I would’ve gotten a p’ama again, just because I feel like Korea would’ve gotten to me. \r\n\r\nQ: Can you describe what it was like when you got your hair done in Korea?\r\nA: The first place, where I got my first initial haircut, was a nice place. It was supposed to be a nicer place, so the haircut costs like $30, which is still really cheap. And then it was nice… everyone was pretty nice and hospitable to me, but they could all tell that I was from the U.S. ‘cause when I talk I have a slight accent, and it’s not the same. It’s like, native Korean speakers. But, again with that haircut I had to lie and say that I liked it even though I hated it. [laughs] And then, that’s why I decided to get my haircut again. And at this place, it was kinda like a more young place, ‘cause the initial place I went to was more of a ‘fancy’, higher end salon, which was in a nice mall, which was why the haircut was more expensive. But the place I went to was kinda in a college area, so it was more like people my age. The cut was really simple—just a one length cut, kinda just below my chin. Dying my hair was the most expensive part. I did like this really light brown; it was almost kinda orangey reddish. \r\n\r\nQ: Was that a common color amongst people in Korea?\r\nA: Uh, it actually wasn’t too common. People actually usually went a couple shades darker. I actually told them that I wanted it pretty much as light as they could get it. I remember seeing pictures and I was tempted to do a reddish color, but I chickened out at the last minute and decided to go with a more brownish red. \r\n\r\nQ: And you said that when you came back to the U.S. with that color and cut, the reaction was…\r\nA: “OMG you look like someone I saw in Korean TV.” And I didn’t mind it… not so much that I didn’t like it, but it was more like, funny. \r\n\r\nQ: Is there an equal balance as being portrayed as Korean versus American? Like being fobby is being strictly portrayed as Korean…?\r\nA: That’s true… but you can’t really be portrayed as a fob if you’re not in America.\r\n\r\nOh actually, I just remembered! My mom’s the one that suggested that I should get a p’ama ‘cause I remember telling her that I was bored with my hair and she was like, “oh you should get a p’ama since your hair’s finally kinda long!”\r\n\r\nQ: Is it usually your mom that’s recommending these kinds of hairstyles?\r\nA: I dunno, not necessarily. I think it’s just kinda a girl thing. \r\n\r\nQ: How did she like your hair when you came back from Korea?\r\nA: She liked it… She thought it was cute. \r\n\r\nQ: You never did anything else to your hair?\r\nA: Actually, I remember I got highlights in like 5th grade I think? It was right before the summer. They were like blonde streaks pretty much in my hair. But they were pretty thin, like they weren’t thick ones like the tiger stripes, I think that’s what people called them, used to get.\r\n\r\nQ: Did a lot of girls have them? Like, around your age?\r\nA: Uh… not too many people my age had them, so that’s why a lot of my friends my age were like “ooh, that’s so cool, I wish I could get them.” ‘Cause I remember I really wanted them because one of my friends Eliza, her mom owned a salon (also Korean)—actually a lot of people actually go to her mom—but um, she had a hair salon in her garage. And so, she got highlights in like 4th grade and I really really wanted to go get them and I begged my mom. But she said that 4th grade was too young and so in 5th grade she was like, “Okay, you can get highlights,” but it was too expensive to do it in the salon, and she didn’t want to spend that much money so she just bought a box and did it for me at home.\r\n\r\nQ: Did she do anything else at home for you?\r\nA: Um, she cut my hair a couple times. And she’s dyed it too, I think.\r\n\r\nQ: And that’s just to save money…?\r\nA: I think cutting the hair was to save money. But then, when she realized that she couldn’t cut it straight and that it was turning into boy cuts, she kinda stopped that. And then dying the hair—my mom was always pretty lenient about letting us change our hair color or like hair cuts or something as long as it wasn’t something too crazy. When I dyed my hair, it would always be a pretty standard brown color, just at home box dyes, stuff like that. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think other Korean moms would let their kids do that?\r\nA: I know some moms were really strict—or not necessarily moms, but dads would be pretty strict about girls changing their hair... especially if they wanted to dye it or even cutting it too short. And I know a couple of parents are pretty crazy about that kinda stuff. \r\n\r\nQ: About dying and cutting?\r\nA: I think it depends on the haircut. But, there are a lot of parents who don’t like it when kids dye their hair.\r\n\r\nQ: What about the cuts, though? Are those for girls and guys?\r\nA: I think they don’t like it if guys have like crazy hair cut. Sometimes they don’t like it like… they want them to have something more standard or non-offensive in any way?\r\n\r\nQ: What would be considered “offensive” by a parent?\r\nA: Like, I don’t know, maybe like a fauxhawk? Sometimes I think it just depends on the parent. Like fauxhawk, or full on Mohawk—that’s not okay for some parents. Or actually a lot of parents would probably not be okay with a Mohawk. (Korean parents)\r\n\r\nQ: Have your parents ever talked about people’s hairstyles that you know?\r\nA: Umm... like crazy hairstyles? Uh yeah, sometimes after church if they see someone’s kids they haven’t seen in a while, they’ll be like “ooh, did you see their hair? They had a p’ama ” or like “oh, their hair is so long now, look at that color.” But they haven’t really said anything too bad about something too crazy… But I know that they don’t like it if they dye their hair a color kind of alike, weird color. Like one of my friends red in her hair for a while and they were like “oh, I don’t like that; I think it looks ugly.”\r\n\r\nQ: So do you think it’s just aesthetic, or like the image they portray?\r\nA: I think it’s like, half and half. Both.\r\n\r\nQ: And they’d voice that opinion with you too?\r\nA: Yeah… like I remember I kinda wanted to have purple in my hair, in high school or something like that. But the more I thought about it the more stupid it seemed. Like, if I really wanted to have it I would have to bleach my hair for it to really look purple… and I’m really lazy, and I didn’t want to spend that much money. So I decided not to do it… and I don’t think I ever told my parents that I really wanted to. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you know any guys that have had that similar experience? Any Korean guy friends?\r\nA: Um, I know that one guy—like one of my sister’s friends—for fun, his friends cut his hair for him, to like, change up his image and just for fun. But when he went back home he got into like, super trouble with his parents. ‘cause they said that it was disrespectful the way he looked and they didn’t want to see him like that… and so they didn’t talk to him until his hair grew back and he fixed it.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think it looked disrespectful?\r\nA: I don’t think so… but, I mean, some parents are more traditional than others. \r\n\r\nQ: Or, what’s considered a ‘disrespectful hairstyle’? Like, how do you disrespect someone with your hair?\r\nA: I guess something that would seem offensive… like it doesn’t seem normal to them. \r\n\r\nQ: So if it’s not necessarily normal, then parents will see it in a negative way?\r\nA: I think so.\r\n\r\nQ: But p’amas for girls are okay?\r\nA: I think that also depends on the parent. I know that… I’ve heard of some parents who really don’t like it when their daughters so anything to themselves… Like they don’t like it if they do makeup, they just want them to be 100% natural, like don’t do anything. Like, don’t get their ears pierced, don’t wear makeup, don’t… maybe they let them straighten their hair with a straightener, but no straight p’ama, no like p’ama p’ama… or hair dye. I mean, maybe for some people it has to do with money, but I know some parents are just like, super strict.','Veronica Interview.mp3','audio/mp3',14884698,1886039),(305,32,163,235,'Korean-Americans and the Hair Salon','Fieldnotes','Q: Would you consider yourself a Korean-American?\r\nA: Yeah. I think I’m very Korean-American.\r\n\r\nQ: Why\r\nA: I mean, I came from Korea in 3rd grade and it was a struggle fitting it. I kinda fit in better with the Korean-speaking group, but now I’ve just been adjusting in UCLA. But it’s been good. Otherwise, I feel like, in general when I just hang out and stuff or just like talk even, I fit better with people who are from Korea than others…\r\n\r\nQ: But you still feel American?\r\nA: Yeah. I guess. \r\n\r\nQ: Why?\r\nA: I mean, just ‘cause… it’s America. Just being in UCLA. Yeah. It’s just more American. ‘Cause at the same time, if I go to Korea and live there, it would be different; I wouldn’t fit in as well as someone definitely ‘Korean.’ I feel like I struggle… I’m very in-between, but definitely more towards the American side.\r\n\r\nSo I was born in Korea, came to America in 3rd grade for my mom. Yeah, it’s just been, going to school, living with her only. But my mom kinda wanted to fit into the Korean community, I guess? So we moved cities. First we were surrounded by a bunch of non-Koreans in Glendale… so it was mostly white people, Armenian people, and no Koreans. But after a year or two, after stabilizing in the US, she definitely, I guess, missed the Korean community. ‘Cause I mean, she’s old. She misses speaking Korean. And I was just a kid so I could play with anyone, but yeah. \r\n\r\nSo we moved to La Crescenta, where there’s a lot of Koreans. It’s like, mainly Korean and everything’s in Korean. So yeah—grew up there until high school and graduated high school, and came to UCLA. But I still live there, where my mom interacts with only Korean people, which isn’t really great, but its fine. \r\n\r\nQ: Can your mom speak any English?\r\nA: No, not really. I mean, really basic stuff, like ordering fast food, she can do all that stuff. But other than that, not really.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you speak only Korean to her?\r\nA: Yeah, only Korean to her and to all of my family.\r\n\r\nQ: What about your high school friends?\r\nA: I guess mostly English, but I used to hang out with only Koreans. But it’s kinda annoying… ‘cause I feel like this is America. If I just keep speaking Korean without speaking English and not making progress in English, I’m not gonna get anywhere. So I definitely had to break out of the bubble and meet some, like, English-speaking people, I guess? At first I tried hanging out with white kids but… it was too hard. \r\n\r\nQ: Why was it hard?\r\nA: [laughing] Because they’re like, different people! I couldn’t fit in with them. They’re like totally different. I don’t know… thinking and stuff. We weren’t on the same page. I just felt like they’re whatever... Kinda like, easy going and everything? But at the same time, that wasn’t my background.\r\n\r\nQ: Where do you normally get your hair cut?\r\nA: Koreatown. Specifically? Kim Sun Young Hair Salon. \r\n\r\nQ: How long have you been going there?\r\nA: Um, I think a couple of months. Actually, no, maybe like a year or two now. Since like, senior year-ish? Okay ‘cause, this is a true story: my grandma, she was friends with the real Kim Sun Young… like the person Kim Sun Young. So my family always went there. So I was kinda the rebel, like “I don’t want to go there” because it’s so popular, I’m just gonna find my own place. But then, in the end, Kim Sun Young, the ajumma (아줌마), she came and she was like “oh! The place is really good,” so I just went to K-town, tried it out and was like “oh… this is pretty good.” But it’s definitely cheaper, even though it is kinda on the expensive end, but yeah. Through her, I ended up continuing to go to Kim Sun Young. ‘Cause like, a family friend? We gotta go support! Even though she is so big… Yeah, I just ended up going back.\r\n\r\nQ: So is Kim Sun Young an actual person? Like she started it, or she works there now?\r\nA: No, so it’s kinda like In-n-Out kinda thing. Like she started a little store off of her name, started it in America in the 50’s or something, and then chains opened all over the place, and now it’s one of the most popular one’s I think. And we actually know the person so we ended up going there.\r\n\r\nI mean, I think there’s a lot to relate, I guess. I’m pretty good at Korean I think, so I click pretty well with Korean-speaking people, [laughs] but especially with like, ajummas. Or like, a little older ajummas, I guess. I don’t know… I guess they just like me a lot, so we just get along really well. \r\n\r\nQ: Wait, why?\r\nA: I don’t know. I guess they just like the fact that I speak Korean really well. I don’t know. I don’t know why. A lot of ajummas like me. [laughs]\r\n\r\nQ: Do you like the ajummas too?\r\nA: Yeah. I mean, it’s okay. Like, we’re just friends and so it’s not bad.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you normally get your hair cut by the same person every time?\r\nA: Every time. Julie Oh. She’s recently from Korea, too. She was a nurse or something, but she married a rich husband, who also graduated from UCLA, so she was like “I don’t wanna be a nurse, I want to do hair” and so she went to a hair school, started all over again when she was 24, and then yeah. She worked hard in Korea and she used to cut like, celebrity hair too, and whatever married, whatever happened, came to America, and now she continues to work at Kim Sun Young. Yeah, and I somehow found out.\r\n\r\nQ: So you guys are pretty close? I mean, since you know her life story?\r\nA: I think I’ve been to her for a while. And we always talk and stuff. I mean, she always asks me school questions and stuff like that. And that’s how we always start off. And she found out that I go to UCLA, so she was like “oh, my husband went to UCLA!” So it was like, BAM, click. And then, we became friends through that!\r\n\r\nQ: So on an average visit to go to cut your hair, what’s it like? What kind of conversations are you guys having?\r\nA: It’s not that much. Well, I usually come straight from school so I have my backpack and all that stuff. And she’s like, “oh, how was your day? How was school?” and I just kinda talk about my week and stuff, and it’s all friendly talk. And I ask her about her week, and she always tells me stories about her kids—he’s a 3 year old boy or something. And he’s her only child, so I guess she’s struggling. So she always asks me, “did you do this when you were growing up?” and I’m like, “umm… I’m only 19, but yeah I guess.” [laughs] Just sharing stories like that.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you not feel awkward at all though? Like, “oh, I have to be respectful…”\r\nA: No... Oh! Long time ago it was, but since I kept going to her, she knows me and I know her, so no… not at all. We’re like, on good terms, I guess. \r\n\r\nQ: But you still speak chondaetmal (존댓말)?\r\nA: Yeah. But she doesn’t. She stopped. [laughs]. When I was not her friend… but now, she just panmal (반말) everyday. [tone changes]\r\n\r\nQ: [laughing] Wait, why are you saying it like it’s a bad thing?\r\nA: It’s okay! I mean, it’s just… the level of friendship went up I guess?\r\n\r\nQ: What kinda stuff have you done to your hair before?\r\nA: I colored it a lot, I dyed it a lot… Oh yeah, so I was always into hair back then. When I was in 2nd grade, everything was short, but I had bangs like H.O.T. That was about kindergarten to 2nd grade. I don’t know why I had that. And it was yellow right here too (the bangs), like back in the days in Korea.\r\n\r\nAnd then I came in 3rd grade, and in America, they’re like “you can only have shaved heads,” so I was like, “what the heck? What kind of school is this?” So I shaved my head in 3rd grade. I was really mad because I had to blow all that hard work. So, shaved it, came to a Korean community in 5th grade. So I did the old hair again in 6th grade (the yellow bangs). And in 7th grade, I guess I matured or something, so I was like “okay, this is stupid.” So I cut it off, grew my hair out, but my hair wouldn’t grow, so it took until like 9th grade to grow it out. Yeah, it was a long process. And starting 9th grade it was pretty long, and then colored it here and there. \r\n\r\nQ: Like, what colors?\r\nA: Nothing too drastic. I think there was brown phase somewhere. And then I did this wine color. And if you keep it for too long and use the wrong shampoo, it turns orange and stuff. So it became orange at a point. And then, cut it short a couple of times. Not too short. Then senior year, like k’ŭn maŭm mŏgŏtsŏ (큰 마음 먹었어), so I was like “man, I’m gonna grow it out and I’m gonna do p’ama (파마).” [laughs] No, I did it! My hair was like this long, up to my neck I guess, and so I p’ama’d… I thought if you did it, it was just the same length, but it shrunk all the way. And I was like “what is this? This is not what I wanted?” because it was like ajumma style. But whatever. I survived it for a couple of months. And then it worked out—a hairstyle came out. Like 5 months later, it’s at the point I wanted it. It’s like the kŏji (거지) style… you know Tiger-JK? Like that kind of homeless style… on purpose. I did that and then homecoming came along and a friend told me to cut it—I cut it really short—and all the p’ama became… ugly. And then I just straightened it out to normal hair…\r\n\r\nQ: Like you got magic straight? Or you straightened it every day…?\r\nA: No, no, no. Like different shampoo, I guess. I don’t know, some shampoo say like, I don’t know. My mom said that it looked retarded so she’s like, she’s into my hair for some reason, she tries to watch out for me, so she’s like “start using this shampoo—then it’ll be straight,” so I’m just like “okay!” Kept using it; p’ama died out in a week! Waste of $150 right there. I was really sad for that. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you pay for that by yourself?\r\nA: Yeah. I pay for everything by myself, so yeah. But yeah, wasted my money right there. Grew it out… and then by April I cut it short again. It was like, up and down. Depending on the weather. Okay just kidding, by the season. Like during the winter, it’s usually pretty long. But spring and summer, I try to cut it short, ‘cause it’s freaking annoying.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you always get it done at a mijangwŏn (미장원)?\r\nA: Mm, except the dying. I do all the dye by myself. At first, my mom just did it for me, but I started getting a lot of white hair and started learning myself. And then, one day, no more white hair. I don’t know. I dye by myself. Everything else, like p’ama—I only did p’ama one time, though—but I did it at the store.\r\n\r\nQ: Would you do it again?\r\nA: No, I just did all those things because it was high school, I think. Like, you could do all those things whenever you want because you’re still young. But if I do those things during college, I would look pretty retarded. \r\n\r\nQ: But you said you liked the way it looked?\r\nA: I know. Back then, but not anymore. Old pictures it’s like… good times. I don’t regret it, but it was just fun when I had it. It’s just like, “oh, it’s not good, but it’s not regretful.” It’s just, trying those things; it was a good experience. Good childhood memories: different types of hairstyles without anyone telling me what to do. Like usually, parents stop kids, but my mom, she doesn’t care that much. She was like, “do whatever.”\r\n\r\nQ: But you said your mom takes care of you… regarding your hair?\r\nA: No, I mean she just judges. Like, “oh, that was a good cut.” Or like, “mmm, that was a bad haircut!” Stuff like that. She’s just giving feedback, like criticism. But with the p’ama, it was really ugly, so she was like, “you gotta do this.” Yeah. \r\n\r\nOh yeah, and then in junior year, I did another crazy hairstyle too. I shaved off only the sides and stuff—like it wasn’t a Mohawk—but I shaved only this much, and the middle was pretty long. It was p’ama that time too. It was rectangular, 70’s, disco looking hair. I don’t know why I did it… it was just for fun. My friends were like, “okay, let’s just do something stupid” and we just did it together. Some of them are just with friends. Like, “let’s try this, let’s try that” and we just end up doing it. \r\n\r\nQ: Where do you think you guys got the inspiration from? Is it from K-pop? Those kind of people?\r\nA: No, not really. We don’t get it off of K-pop singers… we never saw them. We just… did whatever we wanted. Just one day, we just sit around and say, “what about this kind?” I feel like dying hair, is like, very cultural, I guess? Like, Korean culture? Like, a lot of Korean kids do it. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think CV (his high school) made it different? Like, if you grew up in Glendale, things would be different?\r\nA: Yeah—I think CV’s like all Korean and stuff… but Glendale has barely any Koreans so I’d probably turn out like those wannabe gangster looking people. Just like, white t-shirt every day, and would’ve turned out like that. Actually… yeah.\r\n\r\nQ: What’s the style of all your friends then? They all did those types of hairstyles too?\r\nA: No… only me. My friends kinda just kept their clean hair and stuff. Just plain. But, I just wanted to do weird stuff. I don’t know why. I guess I was just a rebel. But I knew that all of those times, I couldn’t do these kinds of things later on in the future. So, it was it like, “I just want to try it now when there’s no worries.” ‘Cause later, I always think of me going to work, working in a cubicle and if I do those kind of things, then it’s like “what’s wrong with that guy?” type of image. I always thought about that kind of stuff when I was little… like my work future. Thinking, “I could never do this later.” So even if the hairstyle was really bad or really ugly, I was okay with it. And just try out the drastic stuff. But, even now, I can’t do much and stick with  simple hairstyles.\r\n\r\nQ: Would you consider yourself fobby at all?\r\nA: I guess, yeah. I mean, I can’t speak English sometimes and I get the pronunciations wrong. \r\n\r\nQ: But, do you think your style is fobby?\r\nA: Oh, like dressing? Clothes? Yeah… that’s so weird, because Allan said that last week. He was like, “if you keep dressing like this, you’ll be gay.” And I was like, “What the heck? What does that mean?!” And he’s like, “well, if you walk alone, then you just look like a fob. But if you keep hanging out with guys, then you’ll just look gay.” And I was just like, “O.K.”… kinda sad. So now I just try to tone it down. Wear basketball shorts everyday. But yeah, I think I dress pretty fobby. In my opinion, I think it’s dressing neat, but to others I guess it’s gay.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you imagine someone really Americanized with your hairstyles?\r\nA: Yeah, I guess. Like… Filipinos? ‘Cause they do crazy stuff too. Like, they grow out little tails and stuff. I actually wanted to do that, too. It looks pretty interesting. \r\n\r\nQ: Would you ever go to a non-Korean hair salon?\r\nA: I did. When I was young. When I had to shave my head when I first came to America. And in Glendale, I had to go to only non-Korean places. But they’re really cheap. And when we first came [to America] we were really poor, so everything had to be cheap. And the haircut was only $6 or something so we just got it there. They were Armenian ajummas mostly. And Armenians, they always buzz their heads… every one of them. Except for a little bit of spikes. So I had a little buzzed head every time I went. So I was bald for a year. Like, scruff on my head. \r\n\r\nQ: …And after that year?\r\nA: I moved. And after that place I always went to a Korean place. [laughs] Yeah, I never went to an American hair salon ever since I moved to La Crescenta. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you ever want to?\r\nA: Yeah—I kinda want to. You know Ackerman? $15? Last time my hair was really long, I was so down to walk in and ask for a cut. But I read the ratings and they weren’t that good… so yeah; I didn’t go.\r\n\r\nQ: How much does it cost at Kim Sun Young?\r\nA: $20, plus $5 tip. In K-town it’s really expensive. I used to cut it for like $35, $40. And then I went to Kim Sun Young… but maybe it’s because I know that person? Actually, maybe not. But yeah, it’s only $20. \r\n\r\nQ: Where do you think you’d be more comfortable? At an American place speaking English, or a Korean place speaking Korean?\r\nA: Probably a Korean place. Definitely. Because at an American place, I feel like it’s once less thing to relate to. Like, if you go to a Korean places, the cutting people, they all came from Korea recently. And they’re just settling here, learning about American stuff. Like the person who cuts my hair now, she’s really new to K-town—not anymore, but she was very new—and she wanted to know how things work. Like, she didn’t know why people left tips, ‘cause in Korea, there’s no such thing as tip. And just with things like that, sharing culture… just ‘cause I came to America first, it’s just a type of sŏnpae (선배) feeling, just because I know a little more than those people. And just talking, communicating, it’s just really… good. I mean, in the beginning it’s not, but now it is. \r\n\r\nQ: What about for you and restaurants? Is a Korean restaurant more comfortable or an American restaurant? (Regarding ordering)\r\nA: I think a Korean place is better, actually. But I told you, ajummas realy like me. Like, we become friends really well. \r\n\r\nQ: What if the waiter is a young guy or an ajŏssi?\r\nA: The young guy? Yeah… we don’t get close. But it’s definitely easier to express myself, and to be more open in Korean. At an American place, I feel like I kinda have to nunch’i pa (눈치 봐), and try to be generous, because they’re probably having a bad day or whatever. And I try to be extra nice, but at a Korean place, it’s just like “it doesn’t matter. Yeah, can you just bring some of this and some of this?”… no need to nunch’i pa [laughs]. \r\n\r\nQ: What do you call the waiters then? If it’s an ajumma, do you call them ‘ajumma’?\r\nA: Noooo. Usually I just say, “chŏgiyo,” (저기요) but sometimes… if there’s no one… then I say ‘imo’ (이모) or something. You gotta like, be nice to them. If there’s too many people and you say ‘imo,’ she’s like, “this guy’s a troll. He’s just being a troll right now.” But if no one’s there and you call her ‘imo,’ then she’ll feel special or something. \r\n\r\nQ: What do you call the person that cuts your hair?\r\nA: Nuna. (누나) I mean she’s like, young 30’s or something. I think she’s 31 or something. She’s pretty old. She’s one of the oldest hair cutting persons that I’ve had!\r\n\r\nQ: That’s old? How old is your mom?\r\nA: Like 56. \r\n\r\nQ: And what if your mom’s friend, someone around that age, was cutting your hair? What would you call them?\r\nA: Then I wouldn’t go there.\r\n\r\nQ: Why?\r\nA: Because age matters… in my opinion. Like one time, I was looking for a hair place, went to this place, this ajumma is some famous ajumma apparently in Korea and I was like “ooh, I’ll try it out”. Went, oh my goodness, worst hair cut of my entire life. It was like… she thinks it’s the 70’s or 80’s or something. She does the slicked back styles… And I’m like, “oh my gosh she’s a troll right now.” So I learned: old people are bad. And now I only go to young people. So at 31, she’s one of the oldest people. Before, all my haircutting people were 26-27ish. And I think they get more customers because of students… just because they’re younger and they know what’s more fashionable and relatable. And it’s easier to explain. \r\n\r\nAnd you know how they ask you every time, “How do you want your hair cut?” And I used to give so many descriptions, like “I want it this length, and whatever.” But I learned, you can just take a picture and say, “something like this” and now it’s just whatever you want to cut it as. But now I just trust her so it’s okay. Other times, they have picture books. But those are pretty extreme too, so I don’t choose anything from there.

Umm, my family isn’t too traditional (any more). I speak Korean to my parents – have 2 younger sisters, but I speak English to them. There’s some Korean, but rarely speak Korean to them.\r\n\r\nQ: Where do you get your hair cut?\r\nA: A Korean place… I don’t know the name of it but it’s really close to my house in Orange Country.\r\n\r\nQ: How long have you been going there?\r\nA: Umm… [thinking] it’s been a long time since I’ve gotten my hair cut but I think I’ve been going there for like 2 years. \r\n\r\nQ: How did you find out about it?\r\nA: Through my friend. School friend.\r\n\r\nQ: Who’s the person cutting your hair?\r\nA: A guy. He’s like… umm… early 40’s? I think he’s from Korea, yeah. \r\n\r\nQ: When you go, do you have conversations with him? Like the movie portrayals?\r\nA: It’s actually funny because me and my friend went to go get our hair cut, to get perms, and the person cutting her hair was talking to her, like in detail about her life and what college she goes to and what major she is and everything. And yeah, I think that kind of conversation. Umm, they ask me questions, but nothing in detail. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you feel comfortable? Like, are you guys friends?\r\nA: It’s kinda like, I’m just gonna go there to get my hair done. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you have any specific memories of going to get your hair done?\r\nQ: What made you want to get a perm?\r\nA: Different hairstyle…?\r\n\r\nQ: So you always go to the one namja?\r\nA: Oh, I can go to anyone. I don’t really care… Skill wise they’re all pretty equal. \r\n\r\nQ: Could you describe the place?\r\nA: There’s usually like 2 owners, or 2 haircutters—one’s a guy, one’s a girl. And the room’s kinda divided in half. The girl cuts people’s hair on the right, and the guy cuts people’s hair on the left. And like, yeah. People just sit and read magazines and wait to get their hair done.\r\n\r\nQ: When’s the last time you got your hair done?\r\nA: It’s been a really long time… like, last year? Yeah. I remember going there to cut my bangs, but that was it. And getting my perm, was senior year summer. \r\n\r\nQ: Did it turn out the way you wanted? Or has there ever been a time when you went in with an expectation and came out with something else?\r\nA: I don’t think there’s ever been a time where it met my expectations [laughing]. But, I remember when we got our perms done, mine came out better than my friend’s, so she was like “ooh, I wanted your type of hair” but hers didn’t come out as well so she felt kinda like, not mad, but she ended up going back to get her hair redone.\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, did she have to pay again?\r\nA: No—it was free.\r\n\r\nQ: How did your friend find out about the place?\r\nA: I think it was through her mom.\r\n\r\nQ: Have you ever thought of going to a different salon? Like maybe somewhere that isn’t even Korean?\r\nA: Yeah. I think I always wanted to go to a different place, but it’s just that I didn’t know of any? Like that were good or that I could trust, I guess? And I feel like, more than the skill of the person cutting the hair, I think it’s about being comfortable with that surrounding. Like, you know it so you go there…?\r\n\r\nQ: But, you know how you speak English to your sisters, even though you speak Korean to your parents… wouldn’t it be more comfortable to go to a place where you could speak English to them?\r\nA: Mm… yeah. But I don’t know. I feel comfortable with both, so I never really thought about “Oh, it’s uncomfortable for me to speak Korean to them.” Like it was never like a problem. But like, yeah… I don’t think I’ve ever been to like an American hair salon… where everyone speaks English. And it’s also because I go with my mom or something? So she can talk to them in Korean, and be like “ooh, give us good service” and something like that.\r\n\r\nQ: Would you say that your English and Korean are at an equal level then?\r\nA: Mm… I think I’m more comfortable with English, but I can speak both equally. I don’t know… yeah pretty fluent in both.\r\n\r\nQ: What have you done to your hair in the past?\r\nA: I remember getting highlights when I was really young… like in junior high I remember getting this orange type reddish highlights? And then when I first moved to American, I remember our aunt she straight-permed and highlighted our hair for us at a salon. That, getting bangs, perm—I think that’s it. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you like it when you were in junior high?\r\nA: I think I really wanted highlights. And I think I had like, you know like yellowish highlights the first time? So he suggested that color to me so I got it done?\r\n\r\nQ: Did all your sisters get it done, or just you?\r\nA: Umm… I think my sisters, too. \r\n\r\nQ: W\r\nA: Umm… I remember in PE class, like, when we were all sitting by alphabetical order by last name, there was this white guy behind me and he was kinda like jokingly making fun of… I forgot what he said… like some type of like –I mean since it was highlights, like reddish yellow—I forget what he said, but he was basically making fun of me. But I wasn’t offended, it was just a funny type of joke. Not like “you’re so mean” type of thing. I don’t know why, but I feel like it was something like ‘pumpkin’ or something. I don’t know… haha. \r\n\r\nQ: Oh—so was it only something the Asian girls had?\r\nA: Yeah… ‘cause I feel like white people, they wouldn’t be able to get it..? Since they already have light hair. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you ever get your hair done in Korea?\r\nA: Mm... yeah. I got my perm in Korea and I cut my hair in Korea. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think they’re better?\r\nA: Umm, I think that’s just the mentality certain people have. Like, “oh, in Korea they cut hair better, or they have better salons than here.” And I think that it’s a lot more nicer too... like, the salon. I feel like… like my friends say that they have better service. And it’s more sophisticated? I don’t know. Yeah—I heard that when you go to wash your hair, someone follows you, and stuff like that. \r\n\r\nQ: What kind of p’ama did you get done?\r\nA: Yeah… mulgyŏl (물결) p’ama? I think it’s supposed to be a really natural and wavy type. But it never comes out that way [laughs]. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think that’s the person’s fault, or just the nature of?\r\nA: I think it also depends on what type of hair you have. Like, if it’s a lot damaged, then obviously it’s going to come out more curly or if its really thick then it’s not going to come out as much. Also, I have really bad experiences with perm, though. Like it always came out within three months. It never stayed. People say it’s supposed to stay like 6 months to a year, if you take really good care of it. \r\n\r\nQ: So you got two p’amas in your life?\r\nA: I think I got three. One was for my 16th birthday--that was a present from my friends. ‘Cause that was my first time getting a perm and like my mom she didn’t really approve, but my friends were like “ooh it’s a gift” so I got it done. And the second time, I think that was my senior year summer. And then third time was in Korea. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you know why your mom didn’t approve when you were 16?\r\nA: I don’t know… I think it was like.. since it was my first time getting a different hairstyle instead of just getting it cut. And also, she has curly hair too so she’s like “oh, it’s going to be hard to take care of.” And I think it’s also because it was too expensive or something.\r\n\r\nQ: Which one was the worst/best of the experiences?\r\nA: I think, it’s just cuz it never stayed long enough, I guess? And… yeah. And oh! Also, I remember my left side would be very curly and my right side would be very loose. So it would never be equal—like equally permed. And I also have more hair on my left side… I think the second time it didn’t come out as well because two people were doing my hair, and like they didn’t have equal arm strength? So the person on my right did it very loose, so it didn’t come out as much. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you notice that as soon as they finished and showed you your hair? Or once you went home?\r\nA: I think it was once I went home…\r\n\r\nQ: And could you do anything about it?\r\nA: I guess you could… like you could call them and complain and go back and redo it, but I never really… like complained about it. I just lived with it. \r\n\r\nQ: What are their personalities like?\r\nA: Umm… I think it’s a lot different for like Koreans and Americans. But the place I go to—I wouldn’t say they’re friendly—but kinda like how Korean parents are, they’ll act like they already know you and they’ll ask like, “how’s your day?” or “where do you go?” and just be interested in your lifestyle.\r\n\r\nQ: Are they ajummas then?\r\nA: Yeah… I feel like it’d be better to go to a place where a lot of young people go to, with fewer ajummas and more young kids. But I don’t know…\r\n\r\nQ: Do you like your hairstyle right now?\r\nA: It’s okay. I like long hair better than short hair. I don’t think I’ve ever cut my hair shorter than my shoulders.\r\n\r\nQ: How come?\r\nA: I don’t know… I just don’t think short hair matches me so I just keep it long. For my sisters, too. They all have long hair. \r\n\r\nQ: What was it like the last time you got your hair done?\r\nA: Well, the interior was really pretty. Like once you come in, they take your bag and put a gown on you. And then, I guess you sit and drink coffee and then you wait. And then you sit down and play with your hair and ask you what you want. And you tell them, and when I went, they were telling me “you shouldn’t do that, it’s not going to match you.”\r\n\r\nQ: What did you tell them you wanted to get?\r\nA: Well like, certain type of p’ama or perm, and they were like, “oh it’s not going to come out really well on your hair” so they suggested a different type, and yeah, they’re really interactive. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you come in with a picture or anything?\r\nA: No… I always have a picture, but I never would show it to them. Like at home, I’ll always search it up and be like “oh, I really like this hairstyle,” but I’ll never print it out and show it to them. I think I was just… I would just describe it to them. I don’t know why I wouldn’t show it to them. I think it’s ‘cause they might not be able to do it like that?\r\n\r\nQ: But that’s what a lot of Koreans do, right?\r\nA: Yeah… oh yeah! In Korea, they all take a picture and want them to do it exactly the same.\r\n\r\nBut the salon was pretty empty, ‘cause I went during the summer and everyone’s working or has school.\r\n\r\nQ: How did you find out about it?\r\nA: My k‘ŭnŏmma. It’s like… she knows where the good places are.\r\n\r\nQ: What city?\r\nA: Well, she lives in Inch‘ŏn, so I got my hair done there. \r\n\r\nQ: Do you think you’ll ever try going to a different place?\r\nA: I think I’m gonna try to go to a different place next time I get my hair cut… which it going to be soon! \r\n\r\nQ: Different place as in… different Korean place?\r\nA: Mmm… wherever I find. I think I want to try American places, too.\r\n\r\n[interruption of two other friends into the room]\r\n\r\nSo when I went to go get my hair done, the p’ama with a friend, that was like right before college started, and you know how she just got her thing done (the ssanguhpul 쌍꺼풀), it was still bruised, but she still came with sunglasses. So when she had to get her hair done, she took them off and they were like, “ooh, I see you got it done!” but then for her, she didn’t feel uncomfortable about it so she’s like talking about it like “Yeah, it’s still healing” bla bla bla, and that was what they were talking about… and I remember she wanted to get the p’ama I was going to get, but since she already got p’ama a lot and it was dead, they were like “oh, I don’t think it’s going to come out as well” so they did another p’ama for her. And after, her mom came to pick us up and her mom’s like, “why didn’t you get that hair?” ‘Cause her mom always compares… and I remember her telling me that she had to go get it done again. Like, her mom complained so she got it done again at the same place. Her mom always complains. Like seriously, she got a bad grade in pre-calc, and he mom came with her to complain to the teacher, and like, it was crazy. \r\n\r\nEsther: I think I would die if my mom was like that… I can’t take those kinds of embarrassments…\r\n\r\nQ: Do you guys normally go together? To get your hair done?\r\nA: That was just once. We were just good friends. But I remember my first p’ama was with them too, with my group of friends. But I remember the 2nd p’ama, that one came out really fast. And that was when I was gonna… that was the 16th birthday party. It came out really fast and I went to Korea that summer so I was gonna get it done. \r\n\r\nQ: Why do you think everyone wants to get p’amas?\r\nA: I think everyone…\r\n\r\nEsther: ‘Cause it’s easy to take care of… that’s why I want it.\r\n\r\nA: I guess… but I don’t know. \r\n\r\nEsther: Steph Lee, you know how she got p’ama? She said it’s so much easier. ‘Cause you know how when you have this length hair (shorter hair), it flips at the shoulders. And she said when she got p’ama, it’s so much easier.\r\n\r\nA: I think people who have straight hair, the only thing to change their hairstyle is to either cut it, or get p’ama. And I people who have curly hair, they want to get straight p’ama. That’s like with my sister… like my youngest sister she has straight hair and she always tries to curl it with a straightener every day. And I’m like “your hair is so damaged.”\r\n\r\nQ: Do you think it makes people look older?\r\nA: Yeah. I think it does make you look older… like more mature. Like if you get ppokŭl ppokŭl (뽀글 뽀글) then obviously you’re going to look like a kid. \r\n\r\nQ: What about ajummas then? ‘Cause almost all ajummas have p’amas…\r\nA: I think that’s ‘cause they don’t want to take care of it. Like the short hair and ppokŭl \r\n ppokŭl? Just shower and come out and just dry everything.\r\n\r\nEsther: My grandma, when she had it, she did p’ama and then she curled it herself everyday. I don’t know why... it was just halmŏni hairstyle. She didn’t know what else to do. \r\n','','',0,0),(307,59,280,238,'Haeni Ryu Interview White Day 5 Part I ','Audio',' Hi, my name is Sharon.

He works and lives in New York. His family is there too. We keep in touch because of Jeremy.* Jay makes sure he keeps in touch with Jeremy by sending him birthday presents and Christmas presents. We used to travel back and forth, but now that we\'re friends, we stopped. I think Jeremy handles the situation with me and his father pretty well and I am grateful. I don\'t see me and Jay getting back together in the future.\r\n\r\nYou and Jay are both Korean Americans and your parents are first generation. When they found out about your pregnancy, how did they react?\r\nMy parents were very disappointed in me. I don\'t think words can explain how angry my dad was. You know my dad…he is known as \"museun keun ahbuhji.\" I will always remember how angry he was…but at the end you know parents. I knew my parents would have to accept it so I only had to endure it for a little longer. Jay and I really wanted to keep the baby and we planned to get married. After awhile my parents and his parents both agreed that I had to marry Jay before everyone found out I was pregnant.\r\n\r\nWhat was your wedding like? Would you say you incorporated Korean wedding traditions to your wedding?\r\nI had my wedding in Newport Beach in 2002. There ceremony was outdoor and the reception was indoor. It was a small wedding with close friends and family. I wore a wedding dress and did a lot of the usual stuff you expect at weddings. I had a bachelorette party and a bridal shower. I didn\'t do anything that was Korean. I didn\'t wear a hanbok because I didn\'t think it was necessary. My mom didn\'t tell me to wear one, and I didn\'t think I had to. Jay\'s mom didn\'t want me to do paebaek either. I am not familiar with any other Korean wedding traditions except paebaek. \r\n\r\nDo you want Jeremy to have Korean elements to his wedding?\r\nI don\'t think I would really care. I am second generation and I consider myself to be pretty American. Even my parents have become a lot more Americanized. Koren (her younger sister) doesn\'t like dating Korean guys so my parents have already accepted that. We speak English to each other a lot and Korean here and there. My parents talk to Jeremy in English. Jeremy\'s first language is English and I don\'t really think it\'s a big deal to me if he learns Korean. But yeah, I think for the most part it\'s up to Jeremy and what his future wife wants. He\'s third generation so I\'m sure he will be more Americanized than I am, so I kind of doubt there will be Korean traditions in his wedding.\r\n\r\n*Jeremy is Susan and Jay\'s son.\r\n','Consent Form_SH.JPG','image/jpeg',2644073,1887292),(310,14,46,110,'Korean Exceptionalism','Fieldnotes','At 2:46 PM, my sister and I were fighting over a jacket that my sister had taken from me, so we both tried it on.\r\n\r\nD - Oh!

H = Interviewer.\r\n\r\nH - How would you rate your level of Korean pride? from 1-10 (10 being die-hard)\r\nR - Would you define \"Korean pride”, as in pride in the Republic of Korea, or pride in being a Korean-American or of general Korean heritage? or am I being too technical?\r\nH - No, when I asked this to others they asked the same thing.  Both. How would you rate your pride in the country of Korea, the Republic of Korea?\r\nR - 7\r\nH - In being Korean-American, your ethnicity? Your culture, ethnic pride?\r\nR - 8\r\nH - What makes you rank yourself at a 7 (for the previous answer)?\r\nR - Biggest reason is probably because I wasn\'t born in Korea. Only connection I have to Korea is thru my parents and I guess my special Korean pure blood.\r\nH - So do you think 7 is a low ranking?\r\nR - Mm not necessarily, it is pretty high. But I have trouble believing a Korean would give anything less than a 5 for that question. From my observations, Koreans are generally prouder of our ethnicity/mother country than other Asian groups. Probably b/c we were always the underdogs, but are rising up now.\r\nH - Do you still consider Korea to be an underdog?\r\nR - Hell no. We have one of the strongest economies in Asia; we\'re a tech giant, and have huge cultural influence as well (Korean wave).\r\nH - Korean wave?\r\nR - Korea’s cultural influence is referred to as the \"Korean Wave\" (Hallyu)\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_wave\r\nH - So because you weren\'t born in Korea, you have more Korean pride?\r\nR - No, the opposite. If I were born in Korea, I would have more pride, but I would say I’m unique and have more KP than most Korean-Americans.\r\nH - What sets you apart? Or what are you so proud of?\r\nR - I just have a different background. I was born and raised in Koreatown, family went through the LA Riots of 1992, my parents were always involved within the KA community, I went to the only Korea-funded elementary school in the nation, etc.\r\nH - How have your parents been involved?\r\nR - They own a Korean restaurant. My dad\'s been chairman of the Koreatown Restaurant Association, part of the Koreatown LAPD booster association, etc. Koreatown business owners usually get pretty involved with the KA community.\r\nH - Did you attend the only Korea-funded elem school in USA purposefully?\r\nR - It was my parents\' decision, since I was only a toddler. Since they were new immigrants and couldn’t speak English, they wanted to send me to a school with Korean faculty\r\nH - All the teachers speak fluent Korean & English?\r\nR - They were very involved with the school as well, in PTA, etc. No, I’d say half of the faculty was Korean and the rest were just typical mixes of race you would find at a regular school\r\nH - What did you mean by special Korean pure blood?\r\nR - A joke........lul\r\nH - Haha. Do you think Koreans are particularly exceptional?\r\nR - Haha this is something I thought and spoke to a lot of people about. I wouldn’t say biologically or genetically, Koreans are superior or anything like that. Only thing that seems to set Koreans apart are our level of \"coolness\". Other Asians generally regard Koreans as cooler and hipper. We are also much prouder and united. After all, Koreans are one of the most homogeneous races on earth. In the scheme of world events, only explanation I could give is religious...that God\'s been showing enormous blessings and favor to Korea.\r\nH - Because of their evangelical ways?\r\nR - No, God hasn\'t blessed us more because of what we\'ve done. Some people even go as far as to referring to Korea as \"Asia\'s Israel\". God has been just showing more grace to us for some reason. Israel didn’t deserve any special attention either.\r\nH - Why are Koreans much prouder?\r\nR - Hmm...maybe because we\'ve been smaller geographically compared to China. We also gained more unity and pride (\"rallying around the flag\" effect) because we always faced external invasions from China, Mongolia, and Japan.\r\nH - Are you not including SE Asia?\r\nR - True, a valid question is to ask then why smaller countries in SE Asia don\'t have the same amount of pride. I don\'t know too much about SE Asian history, but I would guess they faced less foreign threats. Korea is in between Asia\'s 2 biggest powers: China and Japan.\r\nH - How would you rank Korea, China, and Japan?\r\nR - In what terms?\r\nH - Your own terms. Haha\r\nR - Objectively, judging by each country\'s level of power and influence, I would say Japan, Korea, China. Also, an important criteria is how the world views these countries. Although China is technically stronger than Japan/Korea, the world doesn’t show much favor towards China because it was corruption problems, crappy environment, etc.\r\nH - So do you hold any hostility towards Japan?\r\nR - If I did, it wouldn’t be because of its higher respective ranking. But more because of our historical conflicts and differences. Although I\'d like to say I completely love and embrace Japan\r\nI hold a tiny bit of bias b/c of everything japan did to Korea and how they refuse to acknowledge their mistakes. And how they proposed to the UN that \"kimchi\" is actually a Japanese food, and not Korea\'s. And how they stubbornly fight for the Dokdo island. And how the Japanese emperor refused to attend the 2002 World Cup opening ceremony because it was hosted at Seoul. I’m bitter.\r\nH - Haha as you have the right to be\r\nR - =]\r\nH - Have you seen the CF for Mr. Pizza, claiming that pizza originated from Korea?\r\nR - HAHAHAH What?! That’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. Korea doesn’t even have our own tomatoes and cheese.\r\nH - You’ve never see it? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLA6Bk_ivs\r\nR - HAHAHA IM LAUGHING SO HARD RIGHT NOW. So much passion. The evidence they use is appalling. Only pictures of triangular-shape things that ancient people are eating and an effing BOX ON TOP OF BUDDHAS HEAD. GARLIC BREAD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME\r\nSO EMBARRASSING. AHHHHHHHHHH.\r\nH - HAHAHAHAH SO FUNNY.\r\nR - But yes, this divulges just how prideful Koreans can get. There’s a fine line, and Mr. Pizza CEO has crossed it.\r\nH - Haha.. you\'d consider this too prideful? To the point of absurdity?\r\n\r\nR - Indeed. ABSURD I say\r\nH - What do you think Korea has to be proud of? (Other than surviving through multiple invasions and wars, etc.)\r\nR - Rising from ashes since the Korean War. during the war, Korea is one of the poorest countries. the country didn’t even have enough money to make a bicycle, but now within 50 years, Korea is a world power. Pretty amazing I\'d say. Can’t say the same about Vietnam.\r\nH - OOOOH.. low blow!!\r\nR - heh heh\r\nH - What about the culture?\r\nR -  Hm. Korea did have a pretty rich history and culture with the royal family. one of the oldest countries/institutions according to my World Book, but our culture is heavily influenced by China of course.\r\nH - How would you describe your attitude towards 1.5 generation Koreans? In which things/areas/skills do you think Koreans excel? Why?\r\nR - I have no specific feelings towards 1.5 generation, but I have trouble connecting with them b/c of the language barrier and some cultural differences. I know many 1.5 people, but not really close to any of them.\r\nH - Do you believe that Koreans are the best at everything or most things?\r\nR - Koreans are the best at math and entertainment (dancing, singing, etc.). Among Asians anyway. I think Koreans are good at math because.....um. I believe some races are just naturally better at certain things. Like how Africans are more athletic, etc. \r\nH - If America and Korea were to fight in a war, whose side would you fight for?\r\nR - If we were at war, dang this is hard. I would fight for Korea. Although I\'m born in America, my blood is ultimately Korean. I can\'t imagine myself going to Korea as an American soldier shooting down Koreans. I would cry.\r\nH - If someone were to ask you: \"What are you?\" what would be your response?\r\nR - My first thought and answer would be \"Korean\"\r\nH - How do you define a fob?\r\nR - Literally, fresh off the boat... but I\'m trying to draw a line. Rather than years of living in America, I think people judge them off of how they talk and dress, like their accent, culture, music.

I remember that.  Oh, and this is superstition too, I think. During the summer in Korea it gets really hot and humid so if you turn the fan on and you sleep the superstition is that you’ll die.\r\n\r\nEK: Okay, so how about from the ones you did name—like the red ink and fan—why do you think, or how do you think these superstitions came about?\r\n\r\nSY: Well the fan one I think it directly correlates with how people get heat strokes in the summer, especially in Korea because of how it gets so humid—\r\n\r\nEK: You get a heat stroke with the fan on?\r\n\r\nSY: No, no, no. You just get heat strokes because it gets so hot and because you get heat strokes—I guess they get heat strokes outside and then they come in and sleep and the fan… And as for the red ink—the bloody mary thing is also in Korea not just in America but it’s a little different. It’s called “boonshinsama” (분신사마)\r\n\r\nEK: What’s that?\r\n\r\nSY: It’s basically you call forth the ghosts with the red—like if you draw red circles or something. Oh yeah, I just remembered another one. You’re never supposed to present shoes to your significant other because that means they’re going to run away. Oh, and Koreans have very biased views—they’re very scared of dust. So especially Korean parents they say that someone causes “munji” (먼지) and so they open all the windows.\r\n\r\nEK: Okay, so you know the one about the shoes though—like we know that it’s just a superstition but how come people still believe them…they follow through as in someone won’t buy shoes for their boyfriend or girlfriend.\r\n\r\nSY: It’s similar to how superstitions in America exist. For example, walking under a ladder is bad luck, right? And it’s just—I guess culture habits it’s been prevalent over time. It never just disappeared, they’re just there. I mean these are culture customs that old people pass down to younger generations and they keep it and pass it down to their kids. That’s why superstitions exist. Oh, and here’s another one. If you have some unpleasant guests over, after they leave you throw salt. Have you heard of it? [No.] It’s like what older people do. I’m not sure if they still do it.\r\n\r\nEK: So superstitions are prevalent in older generations?\r\n\r\nSY: Yeah, because society changes to more progressive every generation so it’s only natural that superstitions are more ubiquitous in the past. I’m sure our parent’s parents generation was more superstitious than our parents but because we only have our parents to compare us to.\r\n\r\nEK: I just realized this right now but a lot of superstitions have to do with ghosts. [Yeah] Why?\r\n\r\nSY: I mean—it’s just that—there are some things that are unexplainable so you can just say it’s the ghosts fault. I think it was easier to explain things like that back in the older days. \r\n\r\nEK: That’s true. Okay, this is like a follow up question. So you know how you said that superstitions are about ghosts because you don’t know what else—but how come American superstitions aren’t very ghost-oriented while Korean ones are?\r\n\r\nSY: I think it’s because Korea recently turned Christian so they didn’t have a religion before.

They were part of our life, our daily—almost like rules—of how to live, what not to do. But it’s not in the way that they governed our lives but just that those superstitions were naturally part of our lives.\r\n[I asked for some personal anecdotes, examples, stories]\r\nWhen I had a test, I wouldn’t wash my hair because back then it was bad luck because cleaning your hair meant that you were washing away everything that you studied with water. It was like that with cutting your fingernails and toe nails too. If you cut your finger and toe nails then you were losing all the knowledge and everything that you studied. It was little stuff here and there like these that directed our lives. Many buildings back in the day didn’t have a fourth floor so in the elevator it went from one, two, three and then skipped to the fifth floor. \r\n[I asked what was the biggest, or most “feared” superstition back then]\r\nThe colour red was a big fear of people. Actually not so much the colour red but it was the fact that if your name was written in red then you were basically summoned to die—it was the “kiss of death”.  Similar to the colour of death, white is also connected with death. That is why people do not wear white at funerals. Wearing white at a funeral means you are inviting death to come.\r\n[This makes sense? I always thought people wore black to funerals because black was the colour of sadness and by wearing black, you were showing your sadness and remorse for the person who passed.. But not wearing white to keep death away actually seems to make some sense]\r\nKoreans actually have many ideas of death. Another one is that if you dream of someone who has already died then do not talk with them or go with them anywhere in your dream or else you, too, will die. \r\n[I asked if any of these superstitions were ever thought of as real]\r\nI don’t think I ever believed in any of the superstitions about death. But I do admit that I won’t write my name or anyone else’s name in red. It is more out of respect for the fact that so many people believe that something bad will happen. I choose not to be ignorant.

Okay, so my next question would be why do you think that’s a belief or where do you think that even came from?—Actually do you personally follow that superstition?\r\n\r\nTK: I follow it mainly because my dad does it. I don’t know if he believes it but I think it’s just because. And I think it used to be that back in the days in Korea at night, you didn’t have a lot of light so there was limited vision so you would always end up cutting your fingernails really messy which doesn’t look good. So I think older people told kids that you’re going to have bad luck so that kids cut it during the day. I think that’s the story behind it.\r\n\r\nEK: Oh, I see yeah that makes sense!

That’s why the 100 days was such a big celebration, even today. It was a bigger thing back then because usually babies didn’t live up to their 100th day. Another one was that a pregnant lady was supposed to drink sesame oil before going to deliver the baby.\r\n[Did you follow this superstition for when you gave birth to me or Jane or Rachel? (my two sisters)]\r\nNope. But I cut my nails before my test day for the high school entrance exam. My mother got so mad at me.

I only did it once for my college test. It was the tradition that was conducted for the nationwide test—like college entrance or for a company. \r\n[Where did these superstitions even come from?]\r\nLong time ago—long, long time ago—if you see some animal, it gives you good luck. Like seeing a pig was good luck for money. A snake was good luck for a baby. The number four meant death. The number four means “death” in the Chinese character. That’s why there are no fourth floors in the hospital or apartment in many places. Do not shake your legs because it removes good fortune. So I never shook my legs when I was young. If you write your name in red pen, you will die. \r\n[I heard about the pig meaning good luck but I never understood it]\r\nYou know, like the piggy bank for collecting money. Koreans and Chinese worship the image of a pig as a symbol of wealth. Maybe because the pig is a fat animal…and old people liked little fat and round faces—like moon face. Everything is connected to a good fortune story.\r\n[How come superstitions are believed by older people more than younger generations?]\r\nI think because more Christians and the younger generations are influenced by Western culture due to advanced medical and science knowledge.  \r\n[Do you have any other stories?]\r\nWhen I was younger, there was a superstition that the ghosts—or spirits—would come around and take away your youngest or best child. So many times the youngest/best child would be given a bad name so that the spirits would think that the child is ugly, bad or something. My uncles would always make fun of me and call me mean names.

Bimbap is food dish that can be eaten very easily, but it is not easy to make. My mother helped me with instructions on how to make Jeonjubibimbap. First, she said you need to prepare all of the vegetables, such as white radish, spinach, dried radish greens, carrots, bean sprouts, and balloon flower roots. Afterward, it becomes needed to cut them in pieces and place them in a frying pan. The pieces need to be mixed with radish and put in a pot with some water, salt, and sesame oil and then boiled. For spinach and dried radish greens, they need to be cut in pieces and boiled in a pot of water. The carrots should be cut and fried on a frying pan with cooking oil until it is fully cooked. For the bean sprouts, they need to be cut and salt needs to be put on them to boil with water and then taken out to season. Balloon flower roots need to be salted and chopped to boil with some water and sesame oil. When all of the vegetables are ready, they need to be put in a rice bowl and placed in a circle on top of the rice in a neat pattern. Finally, red pepper paste needs to be placed in the bowl and it becomes a very delicious Jeonjubibimbap. Because Jeonjubibimbap has many different types of vegetables mixed in with it, it is a very health meal. It can be eaten any time, and requires significant work for preparation of the vegetables and it usually takes about an hour to cook.

And if you steal earrings then you’ll become deaf. So I guess the moral of the story is not to do bad things or else something bad will happen to you. I think that’s the point of superstitions though. Nothing is superstitious enough to make it a good outcome to come. It’s always to prevent something bad from happening.\r\n \r\nEK: That’s true.

Although there isn’t a large Korean population in Sweden, his parents chose to move there after his father got a job in Stockholm.  He grew up speaking only Korean at home, but learned Swedish and English in school.  On top of practicing Korean at home, John also went to Korean school for 2 years.  Now, however, he admits that his Korean skills are just “okay” and when he speaks Korean, he has a Swedish accent.  \r\n	John said that he didn\'t particularly enjoy living in Stockholm.  He thought that Sweden was a boring place to live, and wanted to go to Korea or anywhere out of Sweden.  However, h had always wanted to go to the United States, especially to study.  To him, the Swedish school system was boring, mainly due to the fact that students cannot pick their own classes.  He felt that the rigidness of the curriculum restricted what he wanted to do, and the only freedom he had in choosing classes was in picking what foreign language you wanted to study.  When he first told his parents that he wanted to study in the States, they were not too keen on the idea of him coming to the States, but after some convincing, they agreed to let him study in the US.   \r\n	For John, coming to the United States was a new and exciting experience, especially when it came to school.  Unlike the Swedish system, American schools allow their students to choose the classes that they want to.  He enjoys the freedom to choose his classes and likes the fact that he can decide how fast the pace is and whether he can finish school faster or slower.  However, one thing he finds disheartening about the American system is the fact that he is unable to get all of the classes that he wants to. After John finishes at the community college that he attends, he hopes to attend either University of California, Davis, University of Chicago, University of Illinois, or Cornell University. \r\n	John has taken several trips to Korea.  He used to go back every two years with his mother and sister, until his most recent trip in 2011 when he went by himself.  When he went in 2011, he stayed with family and his main plan was to spend time with his family.  However, he had another objective of improving his Korean language skills which would increase his comfort level when speaking the language.  While he would usually stay in Seoul or Busan, in his last trip, he also visited Jeju Island.  He did not particularly enjoy Jeju Island, stating that it was hot and humid, and when he went on a seven hour hike, all he did was sweat, sweat, and sweat. \r\n	John’s overall experience in the United States has been good.  He enjoys the education that he has received thus far, likes the people, and loves the fact that he can easily get Korean Barbecue.  John hasn’t gone back to home for over a year and a half, and while he doesn’t miss Sweden, he does miss his family and friends that still reside there.  When asked about his identity, he says that his identity depends on who he is with.  When he is with his Swedish friends he feels more Korean, and when he is with his Korean friends he feels more Swedish.

Her parents decided to send her to the United States to encourage her to be less timid and to get an American education.  She lived in Los Angeles with her Aunt and Uncle, who have no children of their own.  She attended kindergarten and elementary school in the greater Los Angeles area. During almost every weekend, she has memories of going on trips to places like shopping trips in San Francisco, Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and the like.  Some of the things that she remembers enjoying when she was young were the birthday parties and sleep overs.  While most of her childhood memories in the United States were pleasant, she remembers racism  and discrimination.  One specific example when she went to a public school, she was isolated from everyone except for one Korean boy.  She continued to be isolated until she became one of the brightest students in school, and after everyone found out, she quickly made friends.  She stayed in the United States until she was ten, and came back to the United States for summer school every year until she turned thirteen.  Her middle school and high school years were otherwise spent in Korea.  \r\n	The transition was difficult, “painful” because of the “cultural difference”.  All of her friends in the United States, and there was of course the language barrier.  Her old and new friends in Korea “thought I was a weirdo”.  Although Diane was ten years old, she was placed in a second grade level class.  One day, when Diane was in high school, she asked her mother why she didn’t English anymore.  Her mother told her that when she was laughed at in elementary school because of her accent, and ever since then, she only spoke Korean.  However, even today, she is slightly embarrassed of her accent.  Her father wanted her to go to high school in the United States, but she wanted to go to college in there instead.  In the end, she attended a Korean high school and currently attends a community college in California.  After graduating from high school, Diane worked as a teachers assistant at a math institute and a personal tutor in English. She stayed in Korea for a year and a half after high school. \r\n	In 2009, she came to Santa Monica College (SMC).  She chose SMC because she hopes to go to UCLA, and could not afford UCLA’s tuition at the time.  Currently, she is hoping that her grandfather will sponsor her and pay for her tuition once she transfers.  According to Diane, her schedule is “study, work, sleep”.  While at SMC, she has learned another language, Japanese.  She also works at the school bookstore where she has met many different peoples of different cultures, which ultimately inspired her to be a linguistics major.  She has attempted, and failed four times to obtain her drivers license and says that it’s “depressing as hell” that she has yet to get it.  She believes that she hasn’t gotten her license because she lacks concentration and confidence, and the fact that driving has lost its fun appearance and now just seems scary.  \r\n	Because part of her childhood was spent in the United States, Diane feels comfortable around Americans and finds it easy to become friends with Americans.  By making American friends, she can learn more English and improve her English skills.  When asked about her identity, she says that she’s either more Korean or more American.  Meaning that her identity changes with who she is with: more Korean among Americans and vice-a-versa.  She also feels that life in America is more difficult for native Koreans who immigrate to the United States, mainly because of the language barrier.

Although he was born in Korea, he is a US citizen - his father is an American born Korean who is now residing in Korea.  His status made it difficult to work in Korea, and therefore, his future that was unclear.  When he first came to the United States, Peter went to an international school located in Santa Barbara.  While attending this international school, he lived with two host families, the first being a Hispanic family, and the second a white family where the father was a bus driver.  His placement in these homes were random and he lived with these families for a year.  He studied English at the international school because, despite his father being an American citizen, he did not teach Peter any English.  He remembers on one of first days at school, the teacher told him to turn to page nine to read, and he did not understand the instructions.  After looking around at his classmates, he figured out what he was supposed to do.  \r\n	While he was Santa Barbara, Peter had many incidents that taught him about American life and culture.  For example shortly after he turned twenty one, Peter was eager to buy some beer on his own.  After purchasing the beers, he and his friends drank the beers on the porch of the liquor store.  The police came because they were drinking in pubic, however, after realizing that they were international students who truly did not understand that they were not supposed to drink in public, they were not punished.  The police even went as far as to tell the kids to go drink in the alley, which was more discrete so they would not get in trouble again.  Another experience was when Peter entered the bus with an energy drink that was inside of a brown paper bag.  He was promptly kicked off the bus. Initially he said he was confused, but after thinking about it, he realized that the bus driver thought that he was consuming alcohol on the bus. \r\n	After finishing at the international school, he went to live with aunt who resides in Marina Del Ray, California.  She was a busy person who worked in urban planning and did not have much time to show him around the city or care for him.  According to Peter, she would just buy food from Costco and leave it for him to eat.  Eventually, he tried to move out mainly because he felt like he was being “shamed” out of the house.  Peter moved out to Koreatown and lived in a boarding house for approximately a year.  \r\n	Shortly after he moved out, he began taking classes at Santa Monica College (SMC).  He started off in English as a Second Language (ESL) course.  However, to take many of the classes there, a student must acquire an English 1 level, therefore, it took Peter a long time to begin progressing.  He eventually bought a car, and because of the incurring costs of living (such as rent, car payments, gas, etc), he started to look for a job, mainly because now he was financially independent from his parents.  One of his friends from Hong Kong introduced him to an airline company that he could work at, and he also began to work in a coffee shop in Koreatown.  After getting his car, he allowed his now, ex girlfriend, drive the car. This ex girlfriend caused problems for Peter because she “took his car and... hit things with it”. She got into a small accident and he had to pay the costs that came with fixing the car.  He tried to find the cheapest place because he had to pay out of pocket because he did not want to report it to the insurance company or his parents (mainly because his parents did not know that he had a girlfriend or a car). \r\n	Peter’s experience in the United States is unique.  He states that “even though I’m a US citizen, I live like an international student.  Most of my friends are FOBs”.  He laments the fact that he is still at the community college.\r\n','','',0,0),(334,56,285,248,'Field work (national identity)','Fieldnotes','1.	What kind of neighborhood did you grow up in (Suburban or urban) and what city? What were the ethnic demographics of your middle school and high school? \r\nI was born in and grew up in Los Angeles. I have lived in an urban area my entire life whether it have been in a house or a condo. I attended Good Shepherd Catholic School for elementary and middle school. It was a private Catholic school in Beverly Hills, CA in which Caucasians made up most of the ethnic demographics at my school. I was the only Asian in my grade for a few years until I reached the 7th grade in which another Asian girl, specifically Korean, transferred in. I graduated from Beverly Hills High School. My high school consisted of mostly a Middle Eastern population and Caucasians. There was also a small percentage of Asian students made up of mostly Korean-American or Korean immigrant students. \r\n2.	Ethnically, what kind of friends did you hang out with while you were growing up? Present day? \r\nGrowing up I grew up with mostly Caucasian friends. I had two Filipino friends and some Korean friends that made up the diversity in racial backgrounds of the kids I was friends with. Today, my friends are numerous different races and come from various backgrounds. However, I must admit, most of my friends are now Asian. \r\n3.	Do both of your parents work? \r\nMy dad currently is the only one of my parents to work. He is a real estate broker. My mother is a dermatologist who now stays at home and does not work. \r\n4.	Did your parents teach you any Korean traditions/customs/language while you were growing up?  (chuseok, new years)\r\nGrowing up, my mom tried her best to instill in Korean traditions in terms of food, language, holidays, and especially the customs and mannerisms. To this day, although I am a Korean-American I am very much knowledgable in my Korean heritage in many ways as I follow certain customs as well. I also know how to read and write in Korean as well. \r\n5.	Did you parents reinforce your Korean identity? If not, why do you think they didn’t? \r\nMy parents did not specifically enforce my Korean identity growing up. They tried their best to reinforce both sides of being a Korean and an American as well as they wanted my younger sister and I to acknowledge both cultures and both traditions. We grew up with both cultures essentially. \r\n6: As a Korean American, do you favor your American side or your Korean side? Why? This question is important and if you can please write in a detailed response. \r\nAs a Korean-American, I favor both sides. I really cannot choose. Both sides strongly make up who I am today. Of course, I am an American with American values and traditions that are more alive in the sense that I naturally turn to them like in regards to how I view my future. Although English was probably my second language, I cannot even remember a time when I did not know Korean or English. Growing up it was natural to be bilingual as I am comfortable even today with both languages. However, I am very proud to be a Korean as it shows my roots, my background, and my history; where my family came from and started.\r\n7.	How often were you exposed to Korean culture while growing up? \r\n As a child, my parents took me to Koreatown frequently to the markets and the restaurants. I also followed the traditions of the New Year’s and Chu sok by going over to my grandparents’ houses. My mom taught me how to make the basic traditional Korean foods as well. I even attended Korean Catholic churches as well. \r\n8.	How has growing up in Koreatown reinforced your identity as a Korean American? \r\nGrowing up frequenting Koreatown definitely has enforced my identity as a Korean American as I feel as though I have gotten a larger chance to grow up with my culture as a strong force to my background.

From birth to age seven he was in Korea, then from eight to nine was in the United States, then back to Korea from age nine to twelve, and in New Zealand from twelve to age sixteen, and then back to Korea from age sixteen to eighteen, and he has been in the United States since he was nineteen. \r\n	Young first came to the United States with his family for two years when he was eight  because of his father’s business.  “I came to the US because my parents said it was a good place” and he believed that it would be good because his parents said it would be, and he remembers his time in US being great.  Everything was big, including the palm trees.  Everything was a new experience and interesting, especially the cars in America because they were large and the backseats were “slippery and smooth”.  While he was in the United States at this time, Young attended Beverly Vista elementary.  He brought Gonggi, a Korean game similar to jacks, to school and became popular for it.  He shared some humous memories about when he first came to the United States.  When he was nine years old, he and his sister were going down the elevator to do some laundry.  While going down, both he and sister saw one particular button that was red and shiny, and they couldn’t resist pushing the button.  This caused for the fire department to come.  Luckily, their father was able to explain to the firefighters that they were just kids and that they new to the States, so Young and his sister didn’t get into too much trouble.

They had practiced their English all day to order a pizza with pineapples on it, but once they were there, they employee asked them more questions than they knew the answers to.

The employee ended up calling his friend who spoke Korean so that his sister could compete their order. \r\n	At the age of twelve, Young went to live in Auckland New Zealand with his mother and sister.

At that the time he was there, there were not too many people who knew about New Zealand, and those who did knew it as a “heaven on earth”, but it wasn’t for him.  Environmentally, may have been paradise, but for someone who wanted to live in a globalized world, it wasn’t.  New Zealand was nothing the like United States.

One of my uncles is the pastor of a branch of this church up in Boston. And I know Pastor Daniel because I used to go to his church up in Silicon Valley. \r\nMe: What were your first impressions when you started attending this church?\r\nI: My first impression was that everyone seems like family here. Everyone seems to know each other. And the reason I say family is because when someone does something wrong, there will always be an elder telling you that you are doing something wrong, you should fix this. Just having that courage, it’s like a family.\r\nMe: Do you feeling this is something that is only in this church? Or is it also in other churches?\r\nI: Yeah I think this is something that is only in this church, yeah.\r\nMe: So you grew up in church, obviously, right?\r\nI: Yes.\r\nMe: So would you say that you grew up in Korean-American churches?\r\nI: For eight years, I did. But then I moved to Korea in second grade, and I have been participating in Korean churches in Korea.\r\nMe: So purely Korean?\r\nI: Very Korean, yeah.\r\nMe: What are some cultural practices that are associated with Korean churches?\r\nI: We have morning prayer, so we have service at 6 o’clock in the morning everyday. \r\nMe: Everyday?\r\nI: Yeah everyday. So not everyone has to come. It’s just open. They have service 6 o’clock in the morning. Another thing that Koreans do is that... there is a thing called “Korean prayer”, as the Americans say. So everyone just pray together at once, with a loud voice. Everyone will pray very loudly. When everyone all of a sudden becomes quiet, they say, ‘oh the Holy Spirit’ shut them off’, and one person will finish the prayer. I think that is very Korean.\r\nMe: Why do you think it is done this way?\r\nI: I think ‘cuz it’s somehow combination of previous religious practices in Korea. Because Korea had different religions before [Christianity], like Buddhism, and Confucius was a big influence in Korea. I think it was a part of their culture, so they kind of brought it into Christianity?\r\nMe: So are there any other practices that you associate with Korean-American churches? Or just Korean churches in general? \r\nI: We also have a time during praises, sometimes while we are singing, there will be a time where there will be no voice, no songs, they (the worship band) will play the same core progression, and then everyone will be praying out at once, and then later on they sing back again.\r\nMe: Is this more [practiced] in the previous churches that you have attended?\r\nI: Yeah, not in this church. All the other Korean churches or Korean-American churches.\r\nMe: So let’s talk about LBC. What do you feel are some characteristics of LBC that are strictly Korean-American?\r\nI: I think LBC is kind of unique in the sense that everyone comes from a different background. But at the same time, you end up living up together for a long time. Like we end up being together, even after you graduate. That’s one thing that is very unique. It’s very authoritative. Authoritative in that... I think Pastor Daniel has a lot of respect from other pastors in our church. So if Pastor Daniel says one thing, everyone is going to follow and listen.\r\nMe: Another thing we have been talking about is the names that we use to address people who are older than us. What do you think of that? Can you tell me more about it?\r\nI: Well the term jundosanim means “evangelist”. I think it just means that they are a pastor, but not a senior pastor. It’s a term that is widely used in Korea. \r\nMe: Are there other terms that are commonly used in a church setting?\r\nI: Samonim, it means like if they are jundosanim’s wife or pastor’s wife. We call them samonim.\r\nMe: And what about the pastor?\r\nI: We say moksanim, but no one says moksanim here.\r\nMe: Does gender matter in these terms?\r\nI: We never call a guy samonim. Because it literally means an evangelist or pastor’s wife.\r\nMe: What if you are a female and you are a pastor?\r\nI: You can still say jundosanim. I think someone that we all respect (in this church), she is a female named Rebecca Kim. We called her Becky jundosanim.\r\nMe: What about her husband?\r\nI: Her husband is a pastor, so we call him Pastor Paul.\r\nMe: What about people who are not pastors, those who are not a part of the pastoral staff? Just someone older than you, say in the married group. How would you address them?\r\nI: If they are American, like very Americanized, then I just call their name. But if they are not American, I try to avoid calling them.\r\nMe: Like try not to say their first name?\r\nI: Yeah, I just hope that they will call me first and I will just respond. Or if they are just a little bit older than me, if it’s a guy I will call him hyung.\r\nMe: So recently this church in particular has decided to drop these titles, so what do you think about that? Do you think you will still prefer the old system? Will you still carry on with those names?\r\nI: I have no preference with that. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with dropping those terms. Maybe actually it might be more beneficial, because it kinda makes the non-Koreans feel a little big more welcome, I guess.\r\nMe: Do you feel that the Korean structure of this church makes you feel like it’s more of a spiritual family? \r\nI: Yeah. For me, it does. It’s very important for me, because I grew up in such an authoritative background in Korea where there are hierarchies, so I am so used to people telling me what to do, and if I’m doing something wrong, they correct me. But the problem I am facing since I came to America for college is that everyone is like the same age who I hang out with, and even though I am doing something wrong, people try not to tell me anything. So I have a place where they tell me what to do, and tell me what I am doing wrong so it helps me to be more mature.

That was pretty much for high school students, and I felt special. \r\nS: I heard most of the girls received the candles?\r\nC: yea, that was very typical. \r\nS: When you were in high school, do you think guys must do that way? \r\nC: I don’t know about that. But, he did that. \r\nS: How many boyfriends gave you the candles event? \r\nC: Just that one guy. \r\nS: How did other guys celebrate it? \r\nC: They gave me presents, like watches or necklaces and some kinds of jewelry. These were the most usual events on White Day? \r\nS: Do you prefer to have candles surprise or jewelry? \r\nC: Jewelry. But, the candles are very cute too. \r\nS: Did you always receive something from boys in high school? \r\nC: I guessed so for most of the years. \r\nS: Did you feel jealous? \r\nC: It depends.

And my first question is how long have you been a part of LBC?\r\nInformant: LBC... I have going to LBC for three and a half years now. \r\nMe: What about the campus ministry?\r\nI: Three and a half years.\r\nMe: So around the same time?\r\nI: Ah-hem. \r\nMe: So what were your first impressions when you first started coming?\r\nI: Coming to LBC or LCF?\r\nMe: Both.\r\nI: LCF... it was small back then. I would say it was very small. I think freshmen it was just me and Nikki. Not many juniors and few seniors. People were nice. And when we did Bible study, it was really interesting, and people seemed like they really wanted to study the Word. And I learned a lot through it. I have never been to Bible study before, so it was like a cool experience. I don’t think before I came to the Word of God that seriously. We went through small little sections, just line by line. The leaders just said something about each line, each verse.\r\nMe: Were there any similarities between LBC and the previous churches that you have attended?\r\nI: Yeah. I think the previous churches I have attended were very Korean.\r\nMe: Can you define characteristics of a Korean church?\r\nI: Like ajummah’s that only know how to speak Korean and they talk to you in Korean. I don’t understand them. And the church I went to before, it was bilingual, there were a lot of Korean women and a lot of them were married to White people who were in the navy or something, part of the army. So so the pastor during the bilingual services he would speak Korean, and then he would switch over to English. So it was very long. He also had a Korean accent too. Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish the two. Before that church, I went to a Presbyterian church, which was all Korean. It was mainly everyone was Korean. Most of them were old, like past forties old, like around their sixties, maybe. And so they all spoke Korean, there is only a Korean service, but for the youth they had only English. \r\nMe: Are there any common practices or customs that were practiced? For example, in this church, we use honorifics in the way we address people who are older than us, with jundosanim, and samnim... was that used in the previous churches?\r\nI: Yeah. Actually I have never heard of jundosanim until I came to LBC. But in the past I have always referred to the pastor as moksanim and the pastor’s wife as somonim. That’s about it, though. There is nothing else. But in all Korean cultures you have to use hyung and oppa, or whatever, and stuff like that. I think some other churches kind of use that, but not in the churches I have been. I have noticed when I was on missions trip, LBC is related to sister churches, I have noticed some of the other churches, all the college people and youth people, they use oppa or hyung and stuff like that.\r\nMe: As a later-generation Korean-American, do you identify with those terms? Do you relate to them personally? What are some reasons why you use these terms?\r\nI: Well I used moksanim and somonim just because I guess that’s what you are supposed to call the pastor’s wife. I just them mainly because I was taught to use them. That’s what everyone called these people. I recently stopped, because I hear people referring to [the pastoral staff] with just pastor and their name. So I don’t say moksanim and samonim anymore. I guess it’s what I adapted to, just from what other people call them.\r\nMe: in terms of older people in the church, those not a part of the pastoral stuff, for example people in CG group, would you feel comfortable addressing them directly by name?\r\nI: In LBC? Yeah.\r\nMe: Another practice that was brought up was this concept of Korean prayer, where people gather together and pray out loud together, are you familiar with this unique style of prayer that is only uniquely found in Korean-American churches? Is this practiced in your previous experiences in Korean-American churches?\r\nI: Korean prayer... I guess sometimes we do pray out loud. Not all the time, maybe sometimes... \r\nMe: Here in LBC? Or in your previous churches?\r\nI: Yeah previous churches... I don’t think it was like a sort of like a ritual or event or anything. I guess if we were to pray together, we would pray out loud.\r\nMe: Do you personally identify with this style? Or do you prefer to pray silently? Do you have any personal opinions about this style of prayer?\r\nI: Personally, I think it’s an ok thing to do, I personally don’t say what I am praying, because when I am praying I pray not in words or sentences. I think I can just skip just that whole section of my brain, and just pray silently... That’s just a personal thing, I just feel I can pray more comfortably.\r\nMe: Do do you understand why the reason why prayer is done this way in a lot of Korean-American churches?\r\nI: I never really thought about it.... (long silence). I don’t really know.\r\nMe: When picking a church, in the future, say you move to a different area, are you more likely to find a church that is Korean-based? Or Korean-American, or just any church is ok with you? Does a church being Korean-American have anything to do with your preferences?\r\nI: I don’t think so. Just as long as... there is nothing... there is no reason... I don’t know. \r\nMe: So just in other words, what initially attracted you to LBC, does the Korean aspect of the church influence your decision to stick with this church?\r\nI: No. God led me here, that’s what I believe.','Interview With Kevin Kurata(1).wma','video/x-ms-wma',1585200,1934329),(351,59,280,238,'Haeni Ryu Interview White Day 5 Part II','Audio','S: How about if you didn’t receive anything when you were in high school, did you feel jealous? \r\nH: yea, a little bit.

Everyone living in Korea probably have a good grasp about the feud. \r\n\r\nWhat is your understanding of the feud? Do you know where the conflict originated from?\r\n\r\nTo my understanding, the feud was originated from Japan’s continuous invasions to Korea although the conflict accentuated during period of Japanese colonization. Media had been a greatest source that provided abundant information about the feud. Media still plays as an alarm that consistently helps acknowledging what Japan had done to us in the past \r\n\r\nHow do you personally feel about Japan? Have you ever experienced a sense of repulsion that derived from what Japan had done in the past or in the present?\r\n \r\nI honestly feel very neutral about Japan. I don’t hate or love Japan. However, there are times when my feeling abruptly escalates. An incident like Japan attempting to deprive Korea’s ownership of an island called “dokdo,” but my rage has nothing to do with Japan but the fact that someone is trying to take our ownership.\r\n\r\n What about people around you? Have you seen other people disliking Japan or Japanese merely on the basis of where they are from?\r\n Yes, I have heard a lot about people not liking Japan and its culture. The strong dislike primarily comes from the fact that they are Japanese. I think people with strongest hatred are elders who had experienced it firsthand.\r\n\r\nDo you feel that the hostility is justifiable?\r\n\r\nIn some degree, yes. Although current Japanese did not physically cause any sort of harms, they apparent had in the past. I’ve heard that they did not make any effort to apologize for what they had done in the past but rather attempted to destroy evidence to distort the history; Japan is still obligated to apologize for what their ancestors have done in the past.\r\n\r\nDo you think that the hostility will ever be reconciled in the future? If so, how? \r\nThat is a very tough question. The hostility has grown overwhelmingly large. In order for these two nations to find a convergence in reconciliation, they both need to sacrifice and yield way too much to the point where it is impossible to do so. In their word, I do not think it will be easy. \r\n','','',0,0),(354,35,291,260,'Interview on hostility','Fieldnotes','What is your initial reaction in hearing “Japan”?\r\n\r\nHow would you feel if someone was to steal something of your possession from you? Japan had deprived so much from us that it is hard for me to having a postive sentiment about them. I do have a negative sentiment about Japan. I do highly value their economical prosperity but that is about it. \r\n\r\nHave you heard about a feud between two nations?\r\n\r\nYes, since I was raised in Korea, taking history classes was mandatory, and I have seen through television about conflicts that arose between two nations. \r\n\r\nWhat is your understanding of the feud? Do you know where the conflict originated from?\r\n\r\n The problem probably arose during the Japanese colonization, Japan forcibly depriving dictatorship of Korea, even killing the queen of Korea. In my opinion, the inital hostility arose from the war but later on it is more of how they had resolve the problems. Our ancestors had gone through brutality and humiliation. Japanese’s brutal punishments against whoever fought against Japan were distinctively harsh, frequently involving insufferable tortures. Comfort women, an euphemized Japanese term to call Korean women serving in Japanese brothels during the World War II were virtually sex slaves. They were extremely maltreated. They were forced to have sexual intercourses multiple times while they were pregnant, and while they were bleeding from uterus defections\r\n\r\nHow do you personally feel about Japan? Have you ever experienced a sense of repulsion that derived from what Japan had done in the past or in the present?\r\n\r\nI have experienced multiple times. Not just in the past, the fact that they have not apologize, I believe is a big false. Despite brutalities that can hardly be justified, Japan never had attempted to redress the problems but rather distorted the truth of the history according to what seems beneficial to them. their false assertion of ownership, applying evidence that they can used in favor of, and making unused of other significant historical evidence that proves the island to be ours, really shows their deceptive and distorted tactics that they have been using throughout the history.  I don’t like the fact that they are dragging on the problem until now. They are constantly beautifying their history, making history increasingly distorted.

As Korea gained freedom at the end of the World War II, there was no time where they were able to make an official apology. Japan had used sources from Korea, including comfort women, soldiers, and resource. Despite an apparent exploitation, Korea was never able to express their rage.\r\n\r\nDo you think that the hostility will ever be reconciled in the future?

The government of Japan has persistently denying its wrongfulness but rather indoctrinate people with distorted historical ideas. \r\n\r\nWhat about people around you?

He was, then, 33 years old. We got married as soon the World War II ended. The atmosphere in Korea then was teemed with patriotism with a strong sense of hatred towards Japan. Before the war ended, Fukuyoma secretly courted me, not desiring to make ourselves too visible. However, when the war ended, I still don’t know where the courage came from, but we consensually agreed to make ourselves public and have children of our own. I decided to marry him with a full knowledge of what is going to happen to both of us. Fukuyoma and I had some small disputes deciding where to live. I personally wanted to raise my children in Korea, but we both knew that living in Korea with Japanese surname will severely hurt the children. To be honest, I was not able to accurately predict what the children would go through in Japan having Korean blood in them. I had to pretend as if I was entirely Japanese, dressing and acting like Japanese. When I was married to him, many Korean called me a “maegookno,” a traitor in Korea and threw raw eggs to me. Frankly, since I was not living amongst people whom I need to feel socialize; I don’t really understand what my children had went through. However, I know that their school life was not entirely too easy. Living in suburb of Japan, not many Koreans or Korean-Japanese resided. A small population of the providence allowed people at the schools to be informed about my children having Korean blood. They were easily subjected to be bullied on. A term called “izime” refers to bullying, and back in Japan, suicides resulted in bullying was very frequent. I was very worried about my children as well. Sometimes, my children came in with dirt on their face or shirts that had been torn apart. Although none of my children told me how they truly treated, they had recounted how horrendously they were treated later when they all became adults. Classmates would force them to drink water in the toilet, telling them that they have dirty blood in them, calling them names. I couldn’t help myself but burst into tears. The incidences don’t stop here, unfortunately. My children feel very ailienated by how fellow Japanese friends treat them. They feel out of place and feel like they belong to something else. One of the children thinks that it might be good idea to go to Korea to see if they can identify themselves better there. It was a very abrupt decision, but she packed up her stuff to test herself in Korea. The outcome of this action turned out to be a terrible idea. Some elders who held strong grudges against Japanese treated her horrendously, spanking her in a public place, yelling at her, calling names. She recalled an incidence where she was spanked in a public space while she was speaking Japanese to her friend. Besides this incidence, overwhelming amount of people called her a “wae nom” which is a derogatory word to call Japanese. \r\nThe hardest part of our children’s lives was probably the fact that they cannot identify themselves with either of the nations. They were stigmatized from birth for something they did not have a control over. Korea or Japan did not welcome their presence. Their ego was severely tarnished by their own existence. I still feel devastated whenever I reminiscence back to my old memories. \r\n\r\nHow is current sentiment towards Japan in Korea?\r\n\r\nWell, it is much better than how it was back then. However, Japan’s ongoing interest in continent of Korea makes it extremely difficult for Koreans to embrace Japan. Korea and Japan have had both overt and subtle conflicts throughout past until now and the current sentiments are still negative although improvement between two nations is quite evident. \r\n\r\nIf you can go back to the past, would you have made the same decision of marrying Fukuyoma?\r\n\r\nI..I don’t think I would.

I recall many people talking about how Korea needs to win Japan even if it means to lose other games. I learned that intensity when these two nations match up in a game is not extraordinary.

It may be because he was born in Seoul and moved to the US in 2002.  \r\nWhen I first met him, he had a girlfriend (his second one, and he has had two in his lifetime).  He told me he first had a girlfriend when he was 18-years-old, and he was actually serious about her.  Dubious, I asked him if he thought about marriage at that age, and he told me he would never get into a relationship without thinking about marriage. \r\nJay was also very strict and straightforward about what kind of conduct he expected from a girl that he would like.  when I asked him about his preferences, he replied - verbatim - \"Hair, race, height, style of clothing, and manners.\" \r\nApparently, his ideal girl needs to have straight, long hair; be shorter than him; and can\'t wear revealing clothes (no short skirts, short shorts).

He replied that a girl with a brain usually has better grades and higher career goals than he does (not that that really explains his remark). \r\nAnother answer that confused me as to what was going on in his mind is that he answered that he\'s not into \"random hookups\" or \"one-night stands\" when I asked him if he would ever go on a blind date.  I seriously wondered to myself: what part of \"blind date\" entails hookups and stands, and made me question his experience in Korea.\r\nAt this point in our conversation, Jay said he did not even want to consider marriage before he was stable with a job and well off - he wants to make his wife happy in a stable living family. \r\nAside from this, Jay also joked that it is the job of a man to confess his feelings for a girl of his affection when I asked him who initiated his past relationships.

(I love jjimjilbang, I feel all my stress is gone, my skin becomes smooth and when I lay in the hot floor my back and shoulder pain are relieved.) \r\n술먹은 다음날은 꼭 가야 한다. 이유는 뜨거운곳에서 땀을 쫙 빼면 행오버가 없어지고 숙취해소에 좋다. 특별히 찜질방을 갈때는 또 비가 올때. 애를 낳아서 그런지 비오는 날은 몸이 많이 쑤시고 결린다, 그렇지만 찜질방에 갔다오면 몸이 가볍게 느껴지고, 기분도 산뜻해져.  (I have to go the day after I drink, because as I sweat the hangover is cured. I also like to go to Jjimjilbang when it rains; it feels that on rainy days I feel especially sore and jjimjilbang helps my body feel lighter and happier.)\r\n한여름은 될수 있는데로 안가려고 한다, 겨울이나 비오는날, 바람 부는 날, 추운날에는 달려가야 한다. 빨리 가는 이유는 찜질방이 그리워서.  (I try not to go during the summer; I mostly go in the winter, on windy or cold days as fast as I can because I miss it.)\r\n찜질방에서 hot  tub & cold tub이 있다. 핫텁에서 땀이 날 정도로 (5~10분)있고 그 다음에는 콜드 텁에 들어가서 1~2분 정도 있으면 혈액순환이 잘되서 장수의 비결이다. 온탕 냉탕을 5번씩 왔다 갔다 하면은, 동시에 200개의 침을 놓는거와 같은 효과래. 들어갈때 몸이 따끔따금 하기 때문에. \r\n그리고 피부가 뽀송뽀송해진다.  찜질방 때문에 장수 한 사람은 내 아버지. 아주 건강하시다. 찜질방이 없었다면 안 건강하셨을수도 있다. 지금도 일주일에 2~3번은 꼭 가신다.  (I switch back and forth the cold and hot tubs, it helps with blood circulation. If you repeat this 5 times then it is like the same effect of 200 needles on your body. It helps to bring softer skin. This also demonstrates why my father is very healthy despite his age, maybe he wouldn’t have been it if weren’t for jjimjilbang. He goes 2-3times a week.)\r\n가본 찜질방: 자석방: 방이 다 자석이다. 사람의 기가 +/- 있으니깐 그게 발란스를 맞춰준다. 너무 오래 있으면 굉장이 어지러워 진다 (15분 이상), 안그러면 쓰러질지도 모른다. 온몸에 다른 종류의 땀이 나온다. 일반 땀이 아니라, 몸 안에서 진정으로 나오는 땀이다. 쪼그만한 땀방울들이 나오는데, 한국에서는 진땀이라고 한다. 땀의 필링이 다르다—더워서 뚝뚝 떨어지는 땀이 아니라 아주 천천히 나오는 땀이다.  (Magnet room: the room is filled with magnets; there are positive and negative energy in a human’s body and the magnet room balances it out. If you stay there too long you can be dizzy. The type of sweat produced in this room are real sweat from the body and it brings out a different effect very slowly as you sweat.)\r\n소금방: 소금 덩어리로 방을 만들었다, 벽돌 소금. 소금에 원적외선이 있어서 몸에 좋다. 그 방에서는 계란을 굽는다 판채로 그러면 맥반석 계란이 된다. 하얀 계란이 까매진다, 소금의 기운 때문에.  (Salt room: the room is all salt; the salt has helpful radiation. They also bake eggs there and the eggs turn brown because of the salt’s energy.)\r\n산소방: 바닥은 옛날 온돌방의 온도에 기계를 틀어놓고 아주 많은 산소가 공급되는 방이다. 땀을 다 빼고 그 방에서 쉬면은 무슨 바닷가나 산속에 간 느낌이 든다. 잠이 아주 많이 온다. 굉장히 clean 하고 좋은 산소다. 숨이 잘 쉬어지고 힘들지가 않다. 공기는 시원하고 꺠끗하고 바닥은 따듯해서 잠이 쏟아지고 또 땀들이 많이 나온다. 기분이 너무 fresh해진다. (Oxygen room: There’s many clean oxygen in the room that helps to breathe. The air is cold and the floor is hot making you feel relaxed and sleepy and sweat.)\r\n황토볼방: 황토를 동그랗게 구슬 처럼 만들어서 방에 쌓아놨다. 그방에 들어가서 누우면 황토들이 몸에 다 닿는다, 그러고 찜질을 하면 몸이 상쾌하고 좋다. 허리가 쫙 펴지고 등, 어깨 아팠던게 다 없어진다.  (Clay Ball room: helps with back pain and shoulder pain)\r\n아이스방: 너무나 덥고 힘들었을때 그 방에 들어가서 정신을 좀 차리거나 너무 더울때 아이스방에 들어간다. 방이 냉장고 같애서 거기서 몸이 차가워지면 집으로 간다.

There\'s televisions, pool tables, and the food and drinks are free. People only pay for the masages. In China, if there is a power outage, then people stay at the jjimjilbang. Only the people of the high class can go here. I have been to one in Ghuanzo. The Chinese jjimjilbang charge a high enterance fee but you can eat a lot and they have servers. It\'s a fun experience. You can meet a lot of foreigners and new people.) \r\n\r\n찜질방에서 겪은 Problems: 후불로 내기 때문에 돈을 안내고 가려는 사람들이 많다. 찜질방이 깜깜하니깐 특히 게이들이나 커플들이 애정행위를 한다 그래서 옆에 사람들이 눈살을 찌푸린다. 어쩔때 누가 자고 있으면 sexual harassment를 당할수도 있다, 내가 당한거는 아니지만 다른 사람들이 당할 수 도 있고. 도난 사고도 당할 수도 있다, 직접 당한적은 없다.  (Problems in the jjimjilbang: because you pay afterwards, some people try to run away. Also, since many of the rooms are dark, public display of affection can be a problem to people around them. Sometimes there can be sexual harassment as well or people stealing stuff. I have not experience it personally.) \r\n찜질방이 한국 사람들 인생에 nowadays in Korea over 60 (senior citizens) they go 찜질방 1-2times a week; sometimes even everyday 그런 문화가 정착이 되버렸어. 사우나하고 친구들 만나서 얘기하고. 그렇기 때문에 한국에서의 찜질방의 규모는 상상을 초월해; even comparable to Hyatt Hotel; it’s a One stop area; one floor dedicated to 찜질방 the size of Macy’s. 기네스 레코드에 올라간 신세계 백화점안에 Spa Land.

A lot of times when I get back-pain I can relax there.. There’s a term called 지진다. The direct meaning is burning yourself (grilling yourself), b/c at the spa the floor is really hot. By laying down there, you’re releasing your stress that was clustered in your back. Also, mentally you feel relaxed. \r\n-No not really, whenever I’m really tired. I would go with my friends and family.\r\n-Not very frequently, but once every six months; back in Korea, I would visit there more often because it’s nearby and the looking at the signs made me wanna go. Now, it’s 30 minutes away from my house and I don’t want to drive there just to relax. \r\n-There’s one in Tujunga but it’s very expensive $30, while other places are $20~25, some places are cheaper. It’s mainly the distance. \r\n-If there was one near me, and cheaper then I  would go more often; twice a month.\r\n-two in Ktown, (Wi Spa and Grand Spa); all the rooms: 황토방 (clay ball room), 옥방, 불가마 (fire grotto), Ice room\r\n-I like the clay ball room, because the floor is filled with the balls. When you enter, you plunge into the balls and they’re heated so it relaxes your body; your body feels somewhat more free and liberated from stress and pain.\r\n-I would spend about 7 hours, sometimes all day. There were sometimes when I would spend all night, especially during World Cup I spent all day with my friend. \r\n-In 2010 during the World Cup period, there was a place where many people gathered in front of Radio Korea where you can watch the soccer game. It was during Winter/Spring and it was very cold. A lot of people went to Jjimjilbang  to watch the game. The place was packed, maybe about 150-200 people. (Wi Spa); There is a very big screen in the front area. Even if it’s not during the world cup, they play Korean dramas and shows too where people watch. \r\nAvoid coldness and being crowded; can stay where a lot of people and it’s cozy. It was  a very pleasant experience at the spa. \r\nThere’s a short break time during the game, so many people just relaxed or ate food (kimbap). I did too. \r\nThere were some time zone differences, the game started very early maybe 7AM. So we went there the previous night and spent the night there and woke up early to watch the game. We went there at around 8PM just to get a good spot. I went with 4 of my friends, we would pair up and save the spot. We would just sleep at the spot too; they gave portable chairs to take around. You can also sleep there on that chair. So if we were sleepy we just slept and if we were hungry we just ate. \r\nAny problems: no, I didn’t. But I read something from an article that happened in Korea. Two stories: \r\n1.	I read from the newspaper. One guy was drunk and he went to the hot room and he died. 술에 취하고 몸이 뜨거우니깐 죽었어. They need to regulate those things\r\n2.	I heard about another man who died at Jjimjilbang. He walked into the ice room and as the water from the fridge melted, there was abrasion between the water and the machine and he was electrified and died, There are a lot of problems that need to be assessed.\r\n-I’ve heard a lot of people who died there. Some people even committed suicide. It’s really cheap in Korea so a lot ppl go. One person was dead but others thought she was sleeping and the body was left several days until it reeked and the workers found that she was dead. The workers need to regulate the customers and assess the customers too. Many times they don’t check or care, but they can be watchful and more careful; actively assessing and vigilant.\r\nAnother story I heard from elders is that since people are laying down and it is unisex, but some people engage in excessive public display of affection. I heard in some of the sleeping rooms couples had sex. The workers need to be more watchful to prevent those incidents from happening in public. \r\nCulturally yea, it’s important to Koreans. Going back to the past, Koreans are used to being on the hot floor. 보일러가 있었고 그 전에는 한국 역사에 보면 they heated up the floor. That’s Korean tradition. In Western tradition, people heat up the air. It relates to Korean tradition, they relate heating with health and relaxation. I think it’s important to Korean tradition in that way. \r\n','','',0,0),(373,34,NULL,264,'Intreview at cafe',NULL,'Interview with Damian Kim.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it’s very relaxing. You enjoy fellowship with your friends; the different rooms are cool. It’s like a cheap hotel. You get food there, you can wash there and sleep there. \r\nNope; does not really relate to any special occasions. But sometimes when I am too drunk to drive I will go there, because it’s cheaper and more convenient especially if you have many friends with you. \r\nOnly went twice in my life. Because besides those two times I had no reason to go. When I went I was too drunk to drive. \r\nI think the different rooms might have an effect, but no I do not think they have therapeutic effects. \r\nI’ve been to the super hot room, the cold room, the regular room (sleeping room). The hot room I can only stay for ten minutes before I sweat too much and I have to come out. The cold room I almost got hypothermia. But it’s cool. I went to the TV/lounge room with lazyboys to just relax there. There are many ahjussis there. There is the sleeping room, but you cannot sleep in there because it’s really loud there since many ahjussis sleeping there. The weird part is going to the shower with your friends, because you have to go naked (though it wasn’t my first time at a public shower, I’ve been to one at my friend’s dorm)\r\nThe TV lounge is my favorite because the lazyboys are very comfortable with not many people. You can just sleep peacefully. \r\nI usually stay there overnight 2AM~8 or 9 AM. We just go there to wash up and sleep a bit and play a bit. I don’t spend a whole day there like other people; I think it would be boring and you’d run out of things to do. If it’s just a couple hours then things will still be fresh. \r\nNo, no problems with jjimjilbangs. I probably did not go enough times to experience problems or long enough. \r\nI think jjimjilbang is a cultural thing; lots of people from Korea go like a part of daily life. But for the casual user I don’t think it’s very important to their daily life. \r\nI would go there if I had to choose, then maybe once every other month. \r\n','','',0,0),(374,59,242,185,'Soojin Song White Day Interview 1 Part 2','Audio','1st interviewee Soojin Song @ 3/7/2012 11:37 AM. \r\nQ: Hi Soojin.

But, they often buy more expensive stuff like watches and necklaces. This kid of impacts the other people. You actually need to buy more expensive stuff if you love him or her. I think Chinese is sort of like that. \r\nQ: if he buys you more expensive gifts, it means he values more about your relationship? \r\nA: I guess so. If you really care more about her, \r\nQ: How about if he makes you one breakfast or flower? \r\nA: I will definitely accept it. \r\nQ: Will you be satisfied? \r\nA: I will definitely accept it. As long as they care about relationship, I do not really care about the materialistic stuff. \r\nQ: How about if you already bought him a more expensive stuff? \r\nA: In terms of American culture, there is a concept of given take right?

When I was with them, I really celebrated it. So I cared more about White Day. But, when I am in UCLA, I paid less attention to this day.

No, ebay. Actually, I bought a choco massage pad. \r\nQ: Did you receive anything for White Day? \r\nA: I told him not to give me anything, because I am going home for spring break.

Becuz if it is too cheap, I don’t think the guys will like it too. \r\nQ: Do you think one gender benefit more? \r\nA: I feel like guys benefit more.

I don’t think Japanese really affect me that much. \r\nQ: Do you think you learn something from Korean drama about celebrating? \r\nA: I am not sure about the way of celebrating. But, it influences me more about the idea of romance. They all have idol type romance including idol idea of celebrating white days. So they all do something special events, like balloon and candle events. \r\nQ: Whats the candle events? \r\nA: It should be surprising right? They will ask the girls come over to the apartment. They will turn off the light, and light up all the candles. And it usually writes ‘I love you’. It happens all the time in Korean drama. It’s very normal. When he did that to me, I do not feel surprising, but I feel ‘yea, I got one’. \r\nA: And if you know the girls or guys in the Korean drama, they don’t get the gifts what they expect. They get mad. I assume that if I don’t give the gifts to my boyfriends, he will get mad at me. \r\nQ: Whats your ideal celebration? \r\nA: I would meet him in the morning. I like to go to the beach or San Francisco area.  I like the idea of exchanging. Most likely, I celebrate both Valentines and White Day. I spent good time on the beach and go to fancy restaurant. It’s typical thing right. \r\nQ: What else you do? \r\nA: I guess we talk about how much we love each other? You know on the anniversary day. IT comes back each year so it just like anniversary day. People tried to get someone when the days are coming so they can celebrate it. So people don’t feel left out.  If they don’t get anything, then that means you are not loved by anyone.

Let’s see.. I first started training in taekwondo in 2nd grade. I got in as a white belt and worked my way up slowly to yellow and the respective colors until I reached black belt in 5th grade. After 5th grade, there was a pause because I had broken my leg, and.. three years later after I recuperated, I got back into taekwondo starting at black belt and resumed my training until I graduated high school where I left with 2nd degree and I haven’t practiced taekwondo ever since. \r\n\r\nMe: Alright, what did your curriculum consist of? In a typical day.\r\n\r\nWhen I was first starting training, it was something very simple like learning about stance and punching and breaking and learning to shout in sync with your movements to maximize your potential. And that was pretty much the core of it. Once you got onto passed yellow belt, you had to learn “koryos” or systems of movements before you transitioned into kinesiology. So basically, you would start with punches and kicks and get limber with stretches, and then you would practice your respective movements.. And if your belt was high enough, you could start sparring.. And every session would usually be ended with a minute or two of silent meditation. \r\n\r\nMe: So please tell me about an interesting story about when you did a form (or sparred).\r\n\r\nWell, I remember when I.. This was a really interesting story that’s still being told around among my circle of friends. When I was sparring for the championship round for our local dojo, we had both kicked each other at the same time, but we had almost been knocked unconscious. I just happened to wake up first, so whether I was supposed to get the trophy or not, nobody knows.. But we didn’t really care, we just enjoyed that battle. So it’s not that it’s about winning.. more like how far you can push yourself, and that taught the both of us a very humiliating lesson.\r\n\r\nMe: (haha) Alright, well, how did the curriculum evolve over time? Say when you were a beginner to when you became an advanced belt?\r\n\r\nThat’s a very interesting question. Um, well, you always start with your basics and that was always.. the three things were your stance, your kicks, and the punches from those stances. And it evolved by trying to improve your stance by seeing how dynamic or how fast you could move. So eventually, you started learning different punches like chops and even evolving that into throws.. And front snaps turned into roundhouse kicks.. And as you got a bit better, like coordination and stance, you started incorporating jumping and spinning kicks leading to the main pinnacle or gateway kicks into what is known as the 540.\r\n\r\nMe: Did you enjoy your curriculum? Was there anytime where like “Ahh I don’t want to go to taekwondo today?”, you know?\r\n\r\nThroughout my entire life, I really enjoyed taekwondo. There is no replacement for it. Sure there are other martial arts, but taekwondo is so unique in its emphasis on stance and speed is to be found nowhere among other martial arts.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, I understand that taekwondo is mainly about kicking. In your curriculum, was there any evolving that into say grabbing? I remember you were saying that some stances evolve into throws or et cetera.\r\n\r\nYes, the main emphasis was on kicking, but we did learn like how to do punches and throws, and particularly, one of the main evolutions was that after black belt, we learned a new type of hands on form called knife hands. And that required a lot of practice and experience with your own hands which is why it’s so delayed. And the other thing was, your stance was a lot more developed, so you start to look for faults in other people’s stance, and that was where judo came in. Not that you were learning judo, but you were learning to see weaknesses in other people’s stance, which taught you when to attack.\r\n\r\nMe: Then how about.. do you have an interesting story about a general day in taekwondo? Like a story that’s on the top of your mind?\r\n\r\nI remember after I got my black belt, my master said “Ok, this is your first time joining the black belt training regime.” He warned me that it would be completely different, but me, being so ambitious, said “Oh, I can do it!” So the first thing, instead of going to practice at 8, we got there at 5:30. That was a completely different trial on its own. And then, our warm up was jogging around the parking lot.. not like the mats that we did. It was a completely outdoor exercise, and that affected our perspectives, but honed me just as well. And it was still interesting how you could step up your training just by moving outdoors. So we would run around in the parking lot where the ground was uneven and we had to run over terrain and then we had to do push ups on our knuckles on asphalt.. And that was not as forgiving as the playmats. And then we headed over to the mountains where we started jogging around the mountains.. And then we started practicing kicking outdoors with our shoes on.. And it was just so different, but it was still the same concepts. And just that ruggedness about that training regime was something I kinda hold dear, I guess?\r\n\r\nMe: Right. So where was this dojang that you trained at?\r\n\r\nIt was in Koreatown. It was next to the Aroma Center before it was taken down. \r\n\r\nMe: Is it still there?\r\n\r\nNo, it was taken down.\r\n\r\nMe: Did he take it somewhere else?\r\n\r\nUm, that I’m not too sure of, but once that was taken down, I went to a new dojo after I recuperated from my leg injury, and it was located at Crenshaw and it was more based on Wushu.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, then how often do you go to class a week? Before the knee injury.\r\n\r\nStarting 7th grade, I went everyday after school. So my school ended around 1:30 to 3, so I would get to dojo around 2 to 4 and stay there until 7 or 9, and I didn’t just train all that time. Like there was another office room where I could do homework and such, but for the most part, I did train everyday. Every once in a while, I would join in on Saturday lessons, and once I became black belt, I would train 6 days a week.\r\n\r\nMe: Wow.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes they would assign us offdays, but that would just be going to the dojos and stretching.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok. What did you think of the community at the dojang?\r\n\r\nThe community is very amazing and very supportive.. Very friendly. It was helpful that you were with your colleagues.. And with their parents.. And so it was just so easy for everyone to remember them and know each other.\r\n\r\nMe: So how were the demographics of your general dojang?\r\n\r\nOur demographics? For the first dojo, it was basically 100% Korean with the exception of 2 Caucasian males.\r\n\r\nMe: So let me get things straight. So in beginners’ taekwondo, you had basic punches, stances, and kicks?\r\n\r\nYes, very basic.\r\n\r\nMe: How were your punches?\r\n\r\nIt was a very basic karate punch where your arms act like pulleys and this was just to hone your own stance.\r\n\r\nMe: And what kind of stances did you have?\r\n\r\nSome of the stances are well known in the yoga world, like the horse stance and the warrior stance. But stances that enabled you to achieve balance prepared you for moves that were to be taught. Like a front stance required you to have a different stance than say a 360 kick.\r\n\r\nMe: And from these stances you learned grapples?\r\n\r\nYes, as our stances got better and we progressed, these stances.. the key inhibitor that prevents people from being able to do new moves is stance. Like if the rigidity is wrong, then your stance will inevitably fail. \r\n\r\nMe: Then how have you applied taekwondo in your daily life?\r\n\r\nTaekwondo has affected the output of my life in so many different ways. For one, on the academic aspect.. just the sheer fact of exercising or almost like working out after learning.. That has been known to accelerate the learning curve of almost anything. One of the core values of Taekwondo that our dojo emphasized was that taekwondo was for our mind and not for our body. And that was something I never really understood until I was in middle school where I was still part ways through recuperating from my leg injury, and these two people.. they were bullies at the time.. and that’s when I realized it was more about the shutting them off instead of trying to resolve it physically. And eventually, it worked. I just had to talk. And it resolved itself somehow. I was like, oh, that was cool. Uh, in the physical aspect, it helped me learn sports and helped me accelerate at sports in what I personally believe to really fast. Like because of all the stances I learned, I was able to pick up other martial arts really fast like karate, judo, hapkido, and a little bit of wushu. It also helped me with archery.. It was applicable in so many ways; even in the sports that don’t use legs. It taught you so much about focusing and maintaining your stance that I was able to get good at it.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, so is that it?\r\n\r\nI think it helped me be more creative, too. Cuz when you’re sparing, you’re analyzing all these operative elements. Like when you’re sparring, you’re thinking of all these operative elements of your opponent. You’re taking into account your.. where you are at the time and especially in relation to walls, obstacles, and your opponent. And you spend your time looking for key factors and find correlations and then applying that kind of technique to.. for example, when you’re trying to write a paper, you see key examples that you string together and you realize that “oh, these 50 papers have these same elements to it” and you can write about those, which is also what helped me excel at school as well.\r\n\r\nMe: Final question. Is there any particular memory you had in mind about a real life application of taekwondo whatsoever? Outside of the dojo.\r\n\r\nI’m ashamed to say this, but it was my first fight, I believe, where I had tried to talk my way out of these 2 bullies, and that didn’t seem to work. So I kicked one guy in the rib, and punched another guy in the chest. And then they were both unconscious and I left. And it was before then I realized that there were stretchers there and that I had fractured one guy’s sternum and broke three of the other guy’s ribs. So I think that was.. I think that told me a lot like “Oh I shouldn’t have done that.” I should have just talked better. But that’s a memory I hold in my head whether for good or not, but now I can laugh about it.\r\n\r\nMe: (haha) Thank you very much.\r\n','Arnold Kim.mp3','audio/mp3',6964580,1955012),(400,58,297,276,'Taekwondo (JP)','Audio','Me: So please tell me about your background and experiences with taekwondo.\r\n\r\nI started taekwondo shortly before I came to college. Actually, I tried when I was still little growing up in Korea. But I didn’t get too far because my dad still had a stereotypical idea of how girls should be raised, so he made me stop even though I really liked it. And it was not until the end of junior year in high school that I got to try again. And then I dislocated my toe and I stopped for a really long time! So even though I had tried it before, I feel like my experience with taekwondo didn’t really start until I came to UCLA and joined the club here.\r\n\r\nMe: How do you think the instruction differed from Korea to here in America, or was it homogeneous? \r\n\r\nWell, it’s very difficult for me to say, because the one I experienced in Korea was obviously when I was much younger, as opposed to being here when I joined it. Like I joined white belt level class here and it was all little kids, and I’m like, older! But I have to say that the one here is a bit more structured and it’s more for the instructional purposes. It’s more organized and actually teaches you different types of kicks to prepare you for the next level, whereas the one in Korea.. and sometimes I go back to Korea in the summer and I go to a local dojang to train.. sometimes I see the kids level classes before I start mine, and what I notice is that it’s turning into a fun kind of play for kids. I think there’s a lot of cultural pressure.. The Korean society is very much about academics, so the Korean parents send their kids to the local dojang since everybody does it, but the kids do it and end up losing interest or their parents make them stop so they can focus on their academics. So what happens is that a lot of taekwondo instructors that own their own dojang in Korea can’t be as committed to teaching taekwondo and have to think about how to make it more fun for the kids because the parents don’t take it seriously. So the kids don’t take it seriously. I mean, they learn, and there are still great places to learn in Korea, but I think if you go into any local dojang, that is what you’ll find. I remember I played games a lot in my time in Korea when I started. There was always some sort of game like dodgeball, soccer, or basketball at the end of class\r\n\r\nMe: Is taekwondo part of the school these days? Out of curiousity.\r\n\r\nWell, in the P.E classes, yes, you end up touching on the subject. You touch on it as you touch on basketball or soccer here, but not as much because taekwondo is the national sport in Korea so there are dojangs everywhere. And the Korean kids touch on it at least once in their lifetime. Almost all of them. However short that time may be. That’s why I don’t think it’s as emphasized in school, but we do go over it.\r\n\r\nMe: So it’s a standard part of culture?\r\n\r\nIt is a.. very much a part of Korean culture.\r\n\r\nMe: Well, my understanding is that you are an officer here in the UCLA Taekwondo Club, right? So tell me how.. well even before that. Describe your curriculum. What was your curriculum?\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nMe: Like what did you do in a standard day?\r\n\r\nWe generally have a day where we spar. We practice and we put on our protective equipment and we practice in a match, right? And our coach usually has his timer. Or we have a conditional day where we do a lot of conditioning. Instead of putting on our gear, we do speed drills working on speed and stamina. We also have weight training outside of class and track day.\r\n\r\nMe: Do you guys do forms?\r\n\r\nYes, we do have form practice. Usually, that’s led by an upperclassman or a black belt or an officer. I have led a couple of white belts before, but usually the president and the vice president take over that practice and do rotations, hosting practices Sunday. But usually, it isn’t part of our practices led by our coach. The main week is usually sparring because the tournaments we enter.. national or local, is sparring.\r\n\r\nMe: When you were doing taekwondo before joining UCLA, what consisted of that dojang’s curriculum?\r\n\r\nAverage day consisted of bowing in and then stretching. And then we go down the lines and practice basic kicks like roundhouse, front kick.. Eventually, I think I learned up to side kick.. We would repeatedly do that.. going down the lines. And then, I didn’t even start sparring.. They wouldn’t allow sparring until you were at a certain level. I went to the level I could purchase gear and join, but then had to quit because that was at June and high school was almost over. But starting intermediate level, they would do sparring at the end of class. The dojang I went to was known for its poomsae, so they emphasized proper technique.\r\n\r\nMe: Have you ever done a demo?\r\n\r\nOur club held a demo a couple times this year. Once at the L.A County Fair back in September, and one just a couple of weeks ago for Project Literacy.. the program here at UCLA. They asked us to go, so we did. I went to the on at L.A County Fair. I was going to do it, but I hurt my foot or something, so I ended up doing some stuff at the County Fair.. Oh well! \r\n\r\nMe: Off the top of your head, is there any particular story you’d like to share? Any story that’s on the top of your mind from UCLA Taekwondo.\r\n\r\nFrom UCLA Taekwondo? \r\n\r\nMe: Well, let’s say Taekwondo in general. Any experience that you fondly remember. ..Or unfondly!\r\n\r\nThat’s a difficult question. I think.. The top of my memory.. It’s really hard because.. Even everyday practice is something I fall in love with!','Jane Park.mp3','audio/mp3',9907849,1955749),(401,58,299,277,'Taekwondo (JJ)','Audio','Me: So please tell me about your background and experiences with taekwondo.\r\n\r\nWell I started in kindergarten in a dojang near my house, basically, and the main reason being because they gave free ride home. And I live pretty far away from school, so.. yeah it was like riding between my school and house. So that was basically it and also my mom thought it would be great self-defense. And what was interesting about my dojang was that girls and guys were kinda separated and the girls were training separately.. Like more for defense and boys were more for offense and defense. And I went up to blue belt and then I quit.\r\n\r\nMe: So this dojang was in Korea, right?\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nMe: How would you describe the atmosphere?\r\n\r\nIt’s unlike here; there’s.. the teacher has like the ultimate authority. So he tells you something and you have to do that kind of stuff. It’s not very interactive.\r\n\r\nMe: So your curriculum.. Describe a day in your curriculum. Any day that comes to mind right now.\r\n\r\nThe usual routine of you go there and then change.. And then you’ll like run around and warm up. And then we start with the moves we learned the previous day. And then we’ll work on moves.. like new moves. And then work with a new partner to practice.. That’s the usual.\r\n\r\nMe: So primarily, you guys had punches and kicks?\r\n\r\nUm, so in the beginning, yeah. In the beginning, we just worked on the basic foot move and then arm movement, I guess. And then we work on legs and kicks.. Yeah, but until you get to certain level, it doesn’t get like major, yeah.\r\n\r\nMe: So there were no, like.. grapples or anything?\r\n\r\nNo, not for our experience, but for guys.. Again, it’s kinda different for other dojangs.. like basically they were teaching girls for defense.. there weren’t a lot of grabs.. but if like someone grabs you, you were supposed to do some move to flip someone with some kind of twist move, but we would not initiate a grab, no. \r\n\r\nMe: Alright, then did you guys ever spar amongst yourselves?\r\n\r\nYeah, we spar with designated partner.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, was it like one step sparring? Like your opponent does one move and then..\r\nIn the beginning, it was one move - one move, but when you got to blue belt where I quit, you started to do more sparring and spontaneous moves. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMe: Describe your instructor.\r\n\r\nHe was like.. in his middle 40s. Very Korean. I guess very manly.. And he was actually pretty good with kids. I guess he was pretty strict while we were doing the lesson, but after class, he would be pretty nice. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMe: Can you tell me the demographics.. well, it was in Korea, right? So I’m assuming..\r\n\r\nMostly males. All Korean, yes. For girls.. I think there were six of us? It was pretty small dojang. It kinda varied. I went there for 2 years, so.. And for guys, there were 20 or so, I guess.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, then was there any emphasis on the Olympic taekwondo?\r\n\r\nNo, again, this was more for kids. Again, this was mostly for kids. The oldest one was, I think, in high school.. Yeah, mostly it was for elementary schoolers.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, were they ever strict on discipline? Or were they mainly about the physical part of taekwondo?\r\n\r\nIt was more for discipline.. Like if you’re kneeling down and they’re making you kneel down for like a long time just to train you. If you move, you get scolded, but like yeah. \r\n\r\nMe: Then can you just tell me a brief story about taekwondo in your mind? A very specific story.\r\n\r\nLike when I was a yellow belt, I was supposed to kick the.. what do you call it? The board, I guess. And it was kinda like higher up, so I kicked and I didn’t make it, so I like cried on my back. I was really little, so like I cried.. And usually, when you cry, all the adults stop and try to make things better, but because it was during the practice lesson, it was mainly for discipline reasons. So he like made me stop crying and made me kneel down for the rest of the day. And so I wasn’t able to finish my task that day, so I had to do it another day. That was a sad day.\r\n\r\nMe: Was a front kick? Out of curiousity.\r\n\r\nIt was kinda like a side kick? Like.. yeah. I don’t remember much anymore.\r\n\r\nMe: Have you ever visited an American dojang?\r\n\r\nNo, actually, but I kinda learned aikido! But that’s Japanese, so it’s different.\r\n\r\nMe: So would you say.. How would you think taekwondo fits into the Korean society? Like.. in YOUR community?\r\n\r\nThat’s a hard question cuz I didn’t think about it before. But I guess it’s like same thing that here, kids play soccer, but there they do taekwondo or other stuff like piano.\r\n\r\nMe: What do you think most people train taekwondo for? In that dojang?\r\n\r\nWell, my lesson was only kids section, so I didn’t see much adults, but we’re just doing it because mothers made us do it.\r\n\r\nMe: Was it relatively common to send your kids to taekwondo?\r\n\r\nYeah, it wasn’t just taekwondo, but other types of after school programs are like really common in Korea. Like I personally did like five. It’s like one of the arts to kill time.. I think taekwondo was mainly for discipline. And then obviously, you had to do piano.. math, and english... violin.\r\n\r\nMe: What is your impression of taekwondo now?\r\n\r\nNow? I only see it when there’s Olympics going on. And Olympics is different than what we learned cuz they mainly did kicks and defense.. But they don’t use like their fists.. Not like the taekwondo I know. It’s kinda like integrated with Olympics, so it’s different from traditional.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok. Then, finally, how have you applied taekwondo in your daily life?\r\n\r\nWell, the moves that I have learned and such, I have never applied at all. But the discipline I learned from it.. I’m pretty sure it’s ingrained in myself. So I personally think I’m more disciplined than other kids.. especially kids here.. So that’s how I think it relates to my daily life.\r\n\r\nMe: Thank you!\r\n\r\nYou’re welcome!','Joyce Jung.mp3','audio/mp3',4532684,1956257),(402,58,298,278,'Taekwondo (TP)','Audio','Me: So please tell me about your background and experiences with taekwondo.\r\n\r\nWell, my father was the one who really pushed me to do taekwondo. At first, I didn’t like it and I was really rebellious. Um, but eventually, I started to appreciate it somewhat. But I didn’t really like it, so some of the masters there teased me for being so rebellious. I don’t know, it eventually wore me out. I’ve never really been good at exercising, and whenever I exercised, I got angry, so that contributed to my.. So anyway, I quit after a while, but later, my friend who was a black belt at another dojang.. And she invited me and another friend.. So I went, and again.. All the instructors there were Caucasian.. And well, something funny: The main instructor there was female and Caucasian, but her sons were Indian! They were adopted, but they were adults. And they helped with the instruction, but it was very Americanized. \r\n\r\nMe: Ok, then what is your current rank?\r\n\r\nAt one dojang, I was a blue belt at the first dojang, and I quit at yellow belt at the next one! (laughs) Cause it was just so tiring and.. Ugh, I’m sorry, I’m just so..\r\n\r\nMe: No.. No no.. So.. Both of these dojangs were primarily Caucasian, right?\r\n\r\nYeah, well, actually, there were a lot of Hispanics. And in both of these dojangs, there were people of all ages.. There were elderly people.. And they were actually quite tough. When we sparred against them, they showed no mercy, haha.\r\n\r\nMe: Where were these dojangs located?\r\n\r\nWell, the first one was located in North Hollywood. Uh, so primarily, it was Jewish. Like everyone going there was Jewish. You would see little kids wearing their yamacas. The elderly people I think just came along from the Hollywood area. The second dojang was somewhere in Northridge near Food for Less next to 7 Eleven.\r\n\r\nMe: Can you describe for me your general curriculum? What did your average day consist of?\r\n\r\nIn the first one, since there was a kids class, a teenage class.. And there was also an all ages class, but in general, I think it was about exercise. So there’d be a lot of drills for punching, and the blocks that were kinda useless(haha), kicking.. Not a lot of sparring at all, which didn’t prepare me for the second dojo. The second dojo was a bit more focused on learning the actual art instead of just exercise. There was a lot of sparring there which was what turned me off cause I wasn’t that big on fighting.\r\n\r\nMe: Alright. Then tell me a memory that’s on the top of your head. For either of these dojos.\r\n\r\nI’ve always been flexible, so I’ve always been good at kicking high, right? So I remember at the first dojang, we were doing some jump kicks.. and that place was big on jump kicks. They were big on exercise, so it was like jump! jump! jump! And I actually hit it, so it was like..\r\n\r\nMe: Very nice. Well, ok, so of the techniques you learned, how did they differ from each dojang?\r\n\r\nWell, for the first one.. I guess for the first one, the forms.. the basic forms differed. It would be like this form 1, this is form 2.. But the other dojang.. I guess the other dojang didn’t really do too many forms. I think we only went over forms once or twice.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, so it’s primarily sparring.\r\n\r\nYeah, sparring.\r\n\r\nMe: So was it Olympic style, or was it just..\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nMe: Was there emphasis on sport?\r\n\r\nFor the first one, there wasn’t any sport emphasis, but in the second one, I guess they did enter into tournaments. But I don’t think they won anything. It was a really small thing, you know?\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, I’m going to list a few techniques. Tell me if they existed or not in your dojang. Punches, kicks, throws, and self defense.. Did your dojang have those four elements?\r\n\r\nI would say most of them did, but for the first dojang, I would say it was mostly exercise. It was for all ages, but it was for kids. Mostly Jewish kids. It was kinda cute, haha. There really wasn’t much of the hand grabs and stuff like that. We didn’t practice that at all. I think on one occasion, we did practice falling, but that was like once.\r\n\r\nMe: I remember you said your dad made you do taekwondo. So did you ever warm up to that idea?\r\n\r\nYou know, I liked the idea, but personally in practice, I never really got big on it. Like I remember the first time I quit, it was pretty bad. Because my dad made me do it, I remember stepping out of the car that day and thinking I really don’t want to do this. It really wasn’t just the exercise, but the humiliation of just going in there since I was so rebellious and they would always tease me on it. It was just so facetious. Everyone was so happy go lucky and at that time, I was sorta depressed, maybe? Not so much depressed, but I was just frustrated with a lot of things. And as I told you before, I get more frustrated when I exercise, haha. So I remember walking into the door and it had already started. I was late. I wasn’t really eager to go in the dojang and I remember the instructor just looked at me with the biggest smile on his face. I think he told me to do some push ups.. Something really simple and I remember I looked at him and said I couldn’t do this. I had tears in my eyes and it was just humiliating to be there and it was just embarrassing to try and leave, right? I didn’t know how to quit. I didn’t know how to sever the tie, right? But yeah, I kinda just stumbled out of there and as I left the door, I remember the instructor just grabbed my hand. He asked me what’s wrong and he was very caring, and I told him that I really wanted to quit. And you may read in manhwa that the main character is so strong, right? But every time I tried, I just kinda bailed. I think I don’t have an affinity for martial arts.\r\n\r\nMe: Aww, alright. Well, can you describe to me any tradition that you can infer from the dojang? Either of the dojangs.\r\n\r\nThey did this pledge, but I totally forgot it. I think I pushed it out of my mind. After I quit, my dad was just like “Oh, you’re such a quitter!” And not just that, but after the second one, my mom and dad were just like “You’re a quitter, you’re a quitter.”\r\n\r\nMe: I see. How has taekwondo affected your life in the long run outside of the dojo?\r\n\r\nWell, it made me realize that in some respects, I am a quitter. Especially physically. I find it easy for myself to just dismiss it and just say that I don’t need it anyways, and I don’t get that fat! But it was nice to experience such a thing, and while I would probably not go back again, it was good knowing that when things get tough physically, I just quit. But it was good to learn that since whenever I feel like I need to burn fat sometimes, I just do some of that in my room. Just doing it in a methodical way; just the way they taught us. And I do find myself sweating just after a couple minutes.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, has there every been an instance where you had to apply taekwondo?\r\n\r\nThere has never been an instance where I felt I was in danger that I would have to apply that. And since we didn’t really go over the hand grabs, I don’t really think any of that would be that useful. It would probably look like I attacked them first. I think cities have become safe recently, so if you’re smart, you shouldn’t have to use it.\r\n\r\nMe: Can you give me an example of a time where you rebelled against your instructor?\r\n\r\nNot any significant time, but there was a time where he said “Oh, run around.” and I would just start walking. Eventually, I would start moving, but yeah. Towards the end, I wouldn’t have the motivation so.. but I never really walked off the mat except the one day I was quitting.\r\n\r\nMe: Ok, is there any story you want to share about taekwondo? Any further thoughts you would like to share?\r\n\r\nI feel like taekwondo is a very.. community sport depending on the people who surround you. So you might be very enthusiastic or negative about it as I was. Most of the time, I was surrounded by people who were enthusiastic, but I didn’t appreciate a lot of the people. It was interesting and an interesting experience. I would repeat it if I had to, and maybe I would try harder. But I doubt it with my irritation, and you know.. I guess I’m a very solitary person when it comes to exercise, so I prefer jogging.\r\n\r\nMe: Sounds great. Nothing wrong with that.\r\n\r\nWell, thank you. I’m sorry if none of this was helpful.\r\n\r\nMe: No, no. I mean everybody in taekwondo.. will have different experiences with the art.\r\n\r\nWell, thank you for interviewing me!\r\n\r\nMe: Well, thank you for being interviewed by me!','Terra.mp3','audio/mp3',6724671,1957083),(403,58,296,279,'Taekwondo (KH)','Audio','Her: So tell me a story about taekwondo.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was -cause you know there are beginner, intermediate, and advanced level- a story would be.. I remember when right after I got my blue belt, which put me at intermediate level, and it was a whole nother thing. It became difficult. Cause you know, beginner level was easy. It was basic punches, basic kicks, basic stances.. All it was were pieces of a puzzle, right? You did not have to put them together. Sparring was no contact.. It wasn’t difficult. Blue belt was what really tested me. It tested me on how much I really wanted it. Because all of a sudden, regular kicking became jumping kicks, stepping jumping kicks, side kicks, and certain combinations of it. Sparring became contact sparring.. with gear and everything. And I remember one day after class, I had to spar against a black belt.. it was just insane, right? He was just so good.. he was really quick; unlike how a lot of my peers were. They were around my level. So I remember being really tired after that.. Thinking that maybe.. Just maybe I should quit. I didn’t quit though. I kept going.. and so far, I’ve done 3 years of taekwondo. It was definitely a test of will.\r\n\r\nHer: So what motivated you to just continue with it?\r\n\r\nI liked to stick with things I’m not good at. To be perfectly blunt, if you matched my body style with a martial art, taekwondo is not the best match. I hate doing stretches and jumping kicks. But I like to push myself when it comes to these small things. I like to try things I can’t do.\r\n\r\nHer: That’s wonderful. Do you have any experiences with other martial arts?\r\n\r\nYes, before that, I had experienced another Korean martial art, Hapkido. I had around 2 years of Hapkido, and I also had 1 year of western boxing. During my time in Taekwondo, I also did around 6 months of Judo, a bit of Muay Thai, and Savate.\r\n\r\nHer: So of those, which one would you say your body is more suited to?\r\n\r\nI would say savate. You know different martial arts have their different kinds of drills, but I always liked boxing. I liked to use my hands. And what savate does.. It’s all about the footwork and because I did taekwondo, my body is a bit more suited for it now. \r\n\r\nHer: So this taekwondo dojang.. what kind of dojang was it?\r\n\r\nIt was a dojang located in Van Nuys in the San Fernando Valley, and the instructor was French. Her.. She was a 3rd degree black belt.. Currently 4th degree. Her master had a dojang in downtown Los Angeles. He was a 9th degree black belt which was the second highest possible rank. So she knew her stuff, and yes, it was a she. And she was extremely flexible. I noticed that there was a neat distinction between children and adult classes. Children classes.. you know, she would make a wonderful teacher.. Like elementary school. You can see it by how patient she is. Conversely, the adult classes. The beginner adult classes were actually a lot like the children’s classes. Not very difficult. She pampers you essentially. But once you hit intermediate and especially once you hit advanced, it’s like drill drill drill. It’s cardio. You don’t get a break. She will change the curriculum according to class.\r\n\r\nHer: So how would you say Taekwondo’s difficulty level compares with other martial arts?\r\n\r\nI would say that Taekwondo’s a very tiring martial art. Because unlike the others, you have jumping kicks. And that extra motion.. it’s one thing to keep one foot planted as you kick, but it’s another to jump off the ground and make the kicking motion in the air.\r\n\r\nHer: So did you think you were learning something deeply rooted in tradition? Or were you taking it just for exercise?\r\n\r\nI would say that my initial reason for taking taekwondo.. I have always been interested in self defense cause the San Fernando Valley is not the most Asian friendly place. So I always wanted to learn how to fight, right? I didn’t look for that in Taekwondo, but I came to Taekwondo because it was quite frankly the cheapest venue of a martial art. The other places were a lot more expensive. I liked the ambience of this dojo; it’s very nice. It’s like a little community where people watch out for each other. In terms of tradition, we do have tradition. We have to bow to flags as we enter.. we have to learn some Korean phrases.\r\n\r\nHer: Like what?\r\n\r\nLike (insert romanization for Korean phrases such as Gi Cho Hyung Il Bu) So we had to learn the basics, but it was never truly deeply rooted in Korean tradition. If we had a banquet there, it was pizza. We never had kimchi. \r\n\r\nHer: So did you face any opposition at all when you decided you were going to take Taekwondo?\r\n\r\nMy parents never wanted me to take Taekwondo. Because they always thought it was violent. I never thought it was violent, but the idea of the martial art is to kick people, right? I guess that can be considered violent. So they never approved of it, but I paid for it with my job at the time. As for the dojang itself, it was a big variety of races. Although when I say a big variety of races, I’m talking about all races except Asian. I was the only Asian there except for one Filipino girl. 60% Hispanic, 30% White, and 10% other assuming my math works out.\r\n\r\nHer: So you said it was kinda like family, huh?\r\n\r\nYeah, after class we would ask what’s up, you know? Every three months or so, we would hold a banquet or some kind of party like a.. Christmas party.. I remember one time when it was just all of us.. everybody in the dojo. So you had the really little kids, their parents, the teenagers that included me at the time.. And we would just sit there and we would talk about how everything is.\r\n\r\nHer: Sounds really wonderful. So what did you think of the curriculum?\r\n\r\nI think this dojang had a very varied curriculum.. meaning.. you had something called Olympic taekwondo, right? You see one of those matches and their kicks were flashy, high and jumpy. They are not using hands. Our rules include using our hands to the face, whereas, in Olympic taekwondo, you can’t hit someone with you hands. So because our rules are different, our ways of training were also different. We had jabs, crosses.. adopted from boxing as my instructor also took boxing in her early days. So essentially speaking, I once went to a Karate dojo just to check them out. I noticed that while Taekwondo was not like karate.. I noticed.. that if you put me in Karate, I could actually mix in. I would actually feel a little more out of place in an Olympic dojang than a Karate dojo. The curriculum is not, what I would think, is traditional. We also had some degree of hand grabs. Because our background of this dojang was so varied, we had instructors from many backgrounds. Some had experience in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Kenpo, and stuff like that. So they also taught us hand grabs and Hapkido.. and some self-defense measures.. So I think it was a bit different.\r\n\r\nHer: Have you ever been approached with a circumstance where you had to use taekwondo?\r\n\r\nI would say not in a physical confrontation. But in some aspects, I would say yes. Once, someone threw a baseball at me.. While it was somewhat in jest, if that baseball hit me, it may have knocked my glasses off. But because I took Taekwondo, I understood the basic evasive measures and kinda just dodged one way and the ball flew to the side. In other measures, I’d say that it definitely helped out in confidence. So even though I was not in a physical confrontation, you no longer look afraid. You’re a little more confident that even though you are not looking for a confrontation, but without confidence, the level of possibility of getting into a confrontation increases I would say.\r\n\r\nHer: So apart from confidence, what else would you say you took away from your taekwondo experience?\r\n\r\nIt was a good community.. and apart from that, I’d say that it kept me thin..\r\n\r\nHer: Well, you’re still thin today.\r\n\r\nAhaha, thank you, thank you. I’m gaining weight though.. It was good exercise. It was fantastic exercise. And it was like a second family. Our instructor once said it, too. She once said “you might have a lot of problems outside the dojang- whatever it may be -but when you walk through this door, I want you to forget about them. Just focus on the lesson, do the moves, and forget your problems” you know what I mean? “if you’re angry, hit the bag or whatever.. when you’re in this dojang, you’re another person.. a martial artist” It makes you feel like a different person.\r\n\r\nHer: That’s incredible. Are there anymore comments you would like to add?\r\n\r\nTaekwondo’s a beautiful art. Compared to other martial arts it has emphasis on forms, right? It’s a very varied martial art. I notice that.. Maybe I don’t have the best representation of Taekwondo just simply because my version of this art has been so varied in its curriculum, right? But I think that’s a case with most martial arts- they cross breed with other martial arts and they gain new techiniques. \r\nThen that’s it for me, then! Thank you.\r\n\r\nHer: Ah, thank you.','Kevin Hwang.mp3','audio/mp3',8772671,1962488),(404,66,311,284,'interview with Elisun Lee for field work','Audio','1.

I’m here with MF and I’m interviewing her for my Korea183 class: Non-Koreans’ Experiences in Korea. Hello M.\r\nM: Hello. My mouth is full. Can you tell that I’ve been in Korea if I cover my mouth like this? \r\nS: I was just wondering, of all the countries you could go to, why Korea? Was there no choice?\r\nM: It’s kind of not an interesting reason. I had been traveling through Southeast Asia and Tibet and we were planning on going westward toward Georgia and stuff like that, but our plans on getting visas and planes and things totally fell through once we had gotten out of Tibet. So we though, Oh maybe we’ll just go home since we were low on money anyway. So we were heading on the train through China toward the coast where we could catch a plane and we ran into people who told us, Hey you know you could teach English in Asia, right? And we were like, Oh yeah, that would totally get us some money so we started looking into jobs there. And we found out we could make way more money in Korea and we kind of needed the money more than anything so we thought, Hey, why not?\r\nS: Who was ‘we’?\r\nM: Oh so I was with my friend Malcolm.\r\nS: How did you find the job? \r\nM: It was on… I want to say Craigslist, was that even on… this was 2002. But it was some online listing that a lot of teachers used at the time. It was a common way to find teachers and jobs.\r\nS: Where did you work? \r\nM: At a hakwon for kids in Pusan. \r\nS: And how long were you there for?\r\nM: Almost a year. \r\nS: Where did you stay while you were there?\r\nM: They got us an apartment. So most of these foreign contracts, there’s a salary and housing. Which is really good because apparently there is a lot of complications about getting apartments in Korea or Japan. So they provided housing. \r\nS: What was your idea or understanding of Korea before you went?\r\nM: It’s funny, when I think about this and try to remember what I thought before I went there, it’s like I can’t even remember. But I think I knew Korean a little closer. I knew that Korea was part of Northeast Asia and expected it to be more like China or what I knew of Japan than expect it to be more like Thailand or something like that.\r\nS: You’d been to Japan before?\r\nM: I hadn’t, but just by living in western culture you just kind of end up with a lot of exposure to Japanese culture, right?\r\nS: Where are you originally from?\r\nM: Canada.\r\nS: The purpose of this fieldwork project is to collect stories. Do you have any memorable experiences there?\r\nM: Oh yeah, sure. Lots.\r\nS: Or funny things? Or miscommunication?\r\nM: Well, really soon after we started working at our hakwon- the school had a kindergarten attached on the bottom floor, just a regular kindergarten and our floor was English hakwon for kindergarten and also after-school for elementary kids, but it was all owned by the same guy… So really soon after we arrived, there was this festival or something. But we never understood what was going on. Ever. I mean, they did speak English, but it’s like they couldn’t explain it. All the parents came and all the kids came and they were all wearing red shirts. Like Be the Reds shirts, except if they didn’t, they had some other red shirt. And they just did warm-ups. And stretched and stuff like that. And then there were little races with the parents and the kids, mostly the kids. And there was this weird performance where all these kids were wearing sort of fluorescent pink and fluorescent yellow, they looked like pixie costumes, like they were made out of garbage bags. It was more like nylon. The whole time we were just sitting like, What the heck. This is so weird. I mean, it’s fantastic. But what is going on, I don’t understand. \r\nS: So it was like a school event? It wasn’t like an all-Korean event?\r\nM: It was a school event. But we didn’t know what it was for. Or really what we were doing there. We were sort of supervising. But we didn’t really know what we were supervising.\r\nS: That was the only time that it happened?\r\nM: Well, I found that a lot of times traveling, you would be like, I don’t really know what’s going on, but it’s pretty cool. You’d be like, Huh, there seems to be an opera going on in the streets out of nowhere.\r\nS: So it wasn’t like an every week, they would do this?\r\nM: Oh no, no. It was just the once. We should’ve asked when we knew them better, maybe they could’ve explained, I don’t know. Gosh, well we had some really nice travel time. We had vacation over Christmas and New Year’s and we went over to Seoul which was fantastic. We went into a New Year’s downtown near the bell and everything. And I had never been somewhere so crowded before. But it was exciting, not scary. It’s like it’s so crowded that you’re touching people’s chest and back behind you, but it didn’t feel like people were going to stampede or anything crazy. All these fireworks and samul nori troops that go from place to place and stop and play, and we would dance with them. \r\nS: Were other people dancing with them too? Like, everyone was?\r\nM: Yeah. Well, not everybody was, but a bunch of people.\r\nS: Did you ever take part in another tradition or festival?\r\nM: Yeah, a bunch of things. For one thing, there’s this Pusan Buddhism Center and they monthly had an event for foreigners. They do it in English, where they do some traditional Korean thing. Like a traditional Korean craft, like we did calligraphy and we did kite making. And one time there was a kite festival, and then we made kites one month and then the next month we tried to fly them on the beach with everyone else on the beach who was there in Pusan flying kites on the beach. So that was really cool. Also, I studied for taekwondo for a bit. I got a yellow belt. Oh, and I joined a samul nori group, so I played the jangu. And both of those were all in Korean. There was almost no English spoken at all, so it was really confusing all the time, but it was really fun.\r\nS: So you didn’t know any Korean before you went there?\r\nM: No, not a word. We had a phrase book and our phrase book was very good. \r\nS: How did you communicate with people?\r\nM: Well, I mean, in one-on-one situations, usually the person you’re speaking to speaks English and this is part of the reason why I didn’t really learn Korean. But, most of the time there would be English. But we also had a phrase book and phrase books are very helpful. And it’s not like I didn’t learn any Korean at all. There was a lady who ran a vegetable truck on our corner. That’s where I bought almost all my vegetables and she didn’t speak any English. So I learned how to say, How much are the cucumbers this week? Thank you. Oh, can I have some mushrooms. And all that kind of stuff. Um, so yeah, I learned in a very particular context. And of course I learned how to read ‘cause that’s easy. But I don’t understand what I read. I remember one day, I was like, I wonder how you say ‘ice cream’ in Korean. Oh look, there’s an ice cream place… a-i-sŭ-cŭ-rim. And we were like, Oh. \r\nS: A lot of Korean words are actually like that.\r\nM: Yeah.\r\nS: Did you have any negative encounters or experiences with the people there?\r\nM: A few. Not a lot. I generally found Koreans to be very friendly and polite and all those things. There was a guy near the end, soon before I left, I went by myself to Jejudo and I did a bike tour by myself around the outside. I did like four days and it was so nice and slow. Oh, it was fantastic. But this one spot, sometimes the map wasn’t so clear so you have to ask for directions and usually it’s totally fine, safe, and even fun to ask people for directions. So I met this guy on a scooter or a motorbike something, and he was like, Oh you need to go that way. I can show you, so just follow me. So I followed him and it was into the wind so he had to keep waiting for me. Finally, we got to this one spot and he stopped and he took out his penis. \r\nS: What?\r\nM: And I didn’t notice at first. And he was like, Hey. And I was like (shocked face). So I think I swore at him in English and rode away, but I was kind of scared. Like I didn’t know if that meant he wanted to rape me later. He knew where I was going too ‘cause I was like, Well I need to go here eventually so I thought I would try to go this way… \r\nS: And he just left you alone after that?\r\nM: Yeah, he didn’t follow me. Apparently, it’s the case that a lot of flashers, that’s all they want to do. They just want to flash and then that’s it. It’s not really like a threat, they’re just being jerks.\r\nS: Wow, I would not know how to react to that.\r\nM: Well, I ran into some people and I stopped because I was like, Okay people. Safe. You know, they kind of asked me. Somehow it came up that I was concerned and I was worried. And I tried to explain, but they didn’t speak any English and my Korean was so bad. And they were like, What? You have to go to the bathroom? I guess, pointing at my crotch. You have to pee? No, no, nah never mind.\r\nS: Oh wow. How was your experience with the food there?\r\nM: Well, I’m vegetarian which really limited my options. But oh my goodness, it was so good. I even loved going out for… you know when you cook the meat at your table and stuff? Like Korean barbecue. I liked going out for that stuff just because it was fun. I like the chaos and all the stuff that was out on the table and scissors and turning things over and the fire and everything. I couldn’t eat it of course. I would be eating rice or something. Usually I could find something else to eat. But not always. But I liked it anyway, it was just fun. \r\nS: Did people say anything since you were sitting there but not eating?\r\nM: Well I would be out with my colleagues or something. And they already knew I was vegetarian and they always tried to make sure I had something. And they would ask the waiters to bring me food and usually there was something else on the menu. You know how Korean restaurants are sort of like one-menu restaurants. But usually they had bibimbap or something. And you can always have vegetable bibimbap. Oh my favorite was mountain vegetable bibimbap. Sanchae bibimbap and I’ve never seen it outside of Korea of course. You would go outside of the temples and the monks had been collecting mushrooms and greens and stuff like that from the mountains and oh my goodness, it’s fantastic. \r\nS: I really didn’t know that. Did people ever look at you interestingly?\r\nM: Yeah, actually that was the other thing that… Sometimes. Actually at first, we didn’t really notice because we had just come from Tibet and in Tibet, people would literally sit in a circle outside our tent and stare at us and not talk to us and it was really disturbing. So we first got to Korea and wow, no one stares at us. But Pusan, it’s the second biggest city, but it’s still really different from Seoul. Seoul is like its own place. Like while everyone else is much more countryside, even Pusan which is a big city. So we got a lot of stares and people being like, ‘Oh miguk!’ Just kids of course would say that kind of thing. And sometimes I would speak back to them in Korean like, No no, I’m Canadian. But yeah, over time, it became more tiresome, feeling like you couldn’t really walk anywhere without attracting attention. It’s like there’s no privacy. Even if you go walking in the mountains, they just look at you longer. You know, like, That was a surprising a sight… a white person. And they would stop. But sometimes it would be like uohh. But you know. Sometimes people were kind of rudely staring, but most of the time it was more like extra attention just because of the sight.\r\nS: But they would just stare and never approach you?\r\nM: Sometimes people would come and talk to us. But they’re shy. They tend to be very shy.\r\nS: So how many seasons were you there for?\r\nM: Just for one year, so the middle of summer to the early summer next year. \r\nS: So you got to witness a lot of different weather changes in Korea?\r\nM: Yeah, it’s really funny. I noticed that the Koreans and Japanese are really proud of their four seasons. Maybe it’s because a lot of their cultural interactions with countries with three seasons. But it’s completely normal for me to have four seasons. I’m from Canada. But they were very nice. The summer was kind of miserable. But the fall and the spring were really nice. The winter was kind of boring because it doesn’t usually get cold enough to snow. But it did snow. They had gotten the most snow they’ve gotten in twenty years this one day it snowed. It was really exciting because it had been two years since I had lived somewhere with snow.\r\nS: You were saying Koreans and Japanese are very proud of their seasons. Was there anything that led you to that conclusion?\r\nM: Just the way people would talk about it. Like, You know, we have four seasons. I guess, but you get that in Canada too. \r\nS: Do you feel more comfortable interacting with Koreans here more now that you’ve spent time there?\r\nM: Oh yeah, totally. I actually was an English teacher in Vancouver for a year before I came here. I had sort felt like I knew how to interact with Koreans. And Japanese too, because it’s similar culture, but especially the Koreans. Like I have trouble with my own culture, because no one ever taught me. But you know, for Koreans, my phrase book says, my guide book says I should behave this way. And then I practiced and learned and yeah that worked well. So I had instructions and knew how to behave.\r\nS: What are some things you felt like you had to change or you had to be more cautious or aware of when interacting with Koreans?\r\nM: I learned something about group dynamics and I’m sure this is probably true here, but it’s less overtly true. I can’t remember the word, but there’s actually a word. Something like group spirit. Something like that in Korean. And it’s really important. Like if you have positive group spirit, then everyone’s happy. And if you have negative group spirit, then everyone gets miserable. Obviously, you can have positive group spirit and some people can be unhappy or something, but a negative atmosphere can really bring people down quick a lot. So as a teacher, it was part of my job to keep the spirit of the classroom up. I didn’t always know how to do that. I had never been in front of a group of people before. Trying to learn that, I made mistakes for sure. That was interesting. I think one thing that’s always hard for me is that I guess as a Canadian, I’m just sort of honest and blunt in a lot of ways. But in Korea, it’s more important, or you put more value on, sort of keeping the peace than on honesty. And in every culture, they think both the things are important, but some cultures think that one is more important than the other. And I’m used to putting more emphasis on honesty and less honesty on keeping the peace. Especially if the person I’m talking to is someone of higher status as me so I sort of had to like pretend I didn’t think my boss was a jerk when he actually was a jerk. But that did end up being that he had stolen money from us at the end. Yeah, he was embezzling tax money from us. Yeah, but it’s really hard to do anything about it because everything and everyone’s smiley and pleasant and you don’t want to disrupt. It was a fair bit of money for us.\r\nS: And everyone knew about this?\r\nM: No, but we didn’t realize this until the end when it was time to leave. We were like, Oh, we need tax forms. And he was like, Oh sure I’ll get that for you. And he never talked about it again and kind of avoided us. \r\nS: How was shopping in Korea?\r\nM: Well, we’d already gotten quite good at bargaining. We had pretty much sucked when we first got to Thailand, but by the time we left China, the Chinese were like, How did you get that price? I can’t get that price! In Korea, the bargaining is not that strong. In China, you’re aiming for somewhere about 50% the asking price. They say 100 and you say no, 20! And then you both laugh. But in Korea, it’s more of an 80 to 90%. We didn’t buy very much. Except for food. Which we bought mainly from our vegetable lady and our Lotte Mart. \r\nS: Do you have any other stories that you want to share?\r\nM: You know, the north is really beautiful there. On our Christmas vacation, after Seoul, we went to Sŏraksan, which you means ‘snow, craggy mountain.’ And mountains are just vertical, skinny vertical things. And there were tons of snow, I was so happy. It was really beautiful, so that was possible the best thing.\r\nS: How did you travel everywhere?\r\nM: Mostly by train. And Korean trains were just great. Really nice.\r\n\r\nOh yeah! On Jejudo, by then I had already spoken a little bit of Korean, I could say some small things. But on Jejudo, they don’t have much vegetarian foods. Usually the restaurants have their menus written on the window, so I’d go to the window and it’d say, “hoe” which means sashimi. And I’d be like, no. And then it says, “tang,” really gross meaty soup. And I’m like, no. And that’s all I could find in every restaurant. And finally, there’s this one place that says “kimbap” and you can always get vegetarian kimbap and since they roll it right in front of you, you can just tell them, Don’t put in any ham and don’t put any fish in it or anything else that you were going to put in it that isn’t vegetarian. So, I went in there, and I asked her in Korean if I could have vegetarian kimbap. She’s like, What do you mean? And I say, no koki. Like the general word meaning meat-eating flesh. And she said, Okay. No mulkoki. And I was like, Right. And no ham. And she’s like, Ham? Ham is not koki. And I say, yes it is. And like I told you, you’re not supposed to be honest. You’re supposed to be polite and I kind of forgot this. And I said, yes it is. It’s ham. It’s made of pigs. And I say, Yeah, ham is koki. And she says, No ham is not koki! And I tell her, Yes it is! And then finally I was like, Wait a minute what am I doing? Okay whatever. Ham is koki, can I please have it with no ham and no fish? And she said no.\r\nS: She said no?\r\nM: She said no! I think she was mad at me because I argued with her because she was older than me. She just wouldn’t do it so I had to leave. \r\nS: Did you get to eat at all?\r\nM: Yeah, I don’t quite remember what I found. \r\n','','',0,0),(411,44,318,NULL,'Stories of Non-Koreans\' Experiences in Korea #6','Fieldnotes','My wife is Korean and I have been interested in Korea for a number of years. I already had visited Japan and I wanted to go to Korea- I went there for vacation and to meet her family and to spend some time over there.\r\n\r\nShort of three weeks.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t have very many assumptions or pre-thoughts about going, just optimistic. It turned out to be a lot nicer than it turned to be. I was in Seoul for majority of the time. The sections, the new parts of the city, and there were a lot of new parts were actually a lot better than Tokyo. I thought there was a lot more room. Yeah there were a lot of congested—more spacious than Tokyo. In terms of personal pace. Really nice. Very modern. Architecture. Didn’t know what to expect \r\n\r\n2 years before I went. \r\n\r\nI can see similarities and there are degrees in Korean-ness, if you well. Some of the Korean Americans that are Americanized. \r\n\r\nSomething I noticed as far as language, in contrast to LA and the way they speak in Korea. Here, whether they’re very Koreanized or very Americanized. All Koreans in America, “Jŏkiyo” to call people over. They would say “Yŏkiyo” in Korea. Overall, I had found the way they spoke was pretty similar. Pronunciation similar. Some people may not have as much of an accent—dialect was similar between south Korean and la Korean. \r\n\r\nThe people were very kind, very warm. If i may contrast with another country in Asia, in public, they’re much more open to be social. A good amount of socializing in public transportation- it was acceptable, freely converse with others. In Japan, no talking on buses where it’s public. Very quiet. Isolated circumstance where people are talking. Seemed more relax. \r\n\r\nDrinking culture like for u?\r\nMakkulli jib. That was in Namdaemoon. Christina! Where did we get makkulli? Oh Kangnam. As a foreigner, I noticed you don’t pour your own drink. You put your hands under the cup to receive. \r\n\r\nI can understand more than I can produce. It’s around me, between her parents, going to a Korean church, watching Korean dramas, music. Again, I don’t speak Korean, but I can understand it. When a conversation is going around me, I can pick up enough context around me. \r\n\r\nFood was delicious. I like Korean food. I love the street food, and that you do not have in Los Angeles. The best we can do is a ghetto dog, which are good too. They have the hottŏk, the sausage with the bacon wrap, they had all sort of things. Ttŏkbokki, sundae. My favorite was the wrapped sausage with bacon, which is not necessarily “Korean” I like thin ttŏk more than thick ttŏk… hottŏk was really good. One of the things I saw, potato on a stick with cheese powder. There were a lot of great street food, I can say that. Other food, I had- samkyŏpsal, that was good. I actually didn’t like the katsu, the sauce wasn’t as good as I’ve had in LA. I had budae tchigae, we had that two times- i understand the history of that too. We went to a one spot, to a budae tchigae, which was one of their main dishes. They had a really good seafood noodle soup near Inchon on a small island. Not too far from the airport. \r\n\r\nI actually went to Jejudo. Not similar at all. There were cities there, nothing to the magnitude of Seoul, more rural. The people weren’t city folk, you can tell between the city and country. Looked like a slower, island-y. an optical illusion, section on the island- reversed gravity thing, ghost road? Dokkaebi Road. It looked like the way the land was formed, where you’re actually standing, the road looked like it was going up. When you drop a water bottle, it rolls down, but it looks like it’s going uphill. It’s even labeled. They watch their ghosts roll their bottle up.\r\n\r\nAt the fortresses/gates where they would have people have acting as a guard and wearing older costumes and reenacting it. See—pungmul, saw that up at Seoul tower. They were dressed up in the traditional thing and spinning their heads, that was cool to watch. Near Seoul tower which was absolutely modern. \r\n\r\nBut up there, there’s a foot of the tower, a section of the tower with a lot of locks. And each lock, you can lock a little heart to stick there to be permanent- Christina and I did that. And we wrote it on the lock. Which was pretty cool. I liked that idea. I think it’s really interesting. \r\n\r\nThere was a section of Seoul that a lot of shopping, Harajuku of Seoul, where they were used to foreigners. They were trying to talk to me, and they thought Christina was Chinese. No I’m Korean. No you’re Japanese! Her family didn’t treat me like some stranger. As far as the people i did talk to in public, which wasn’t really much , trying to communicate trying to get a coffee, there wasn’t too much interaction with people i didn’t know.\r\n\r\nCoffee shop culture, I like. There’s just a lot. We’re used to drinking coffee here. Which they also have. But they have a lot more. Even though us living in la, we have a lot of independent- you’re thinking like 5 chains, but there were so many more in Seoul. They like coffee. They think it’s a good place to communicate, maybe you want to go on a date. Even in 30s, living with parents better to go coffee- or going to hotel- i saw a lot of them, i went to.. I don’t think I’ve ever been… \r\n\r\nMy kŭn appa would ask that- what are your top 3 tings?\r\n\r\nStreet food, i liked going to the makkŏlli place, Christina grew up with Eunmi and we hung out with her husband. Jejudo was nice, weather was ugly- raining a lot very windy. We toured the studio of YTN- because Christina’s uncle works there. We went to the skyrise and sat in the studio probably wouldn’t normally happen. I liked seeing historical buildings. Like the different buildings. \r\n\r\nFunny stories?\r\n\r\nI’m trying to think of something funny that happened while I was in korea. \r\n*moves to living room with \r\nPoongmul. we did go to a traditional, set up with a guy who wanted to sell us some onion and stones and he gave us a tour and said it was a better tour, and then he gave us a 10 min speech in this room, and offered us his products. And then we felt really bad. \r\n\r\nWe also went to Tŏksugung biggest palace in Korean, we saw a lot of old traditional things, the band that would play for the king, \r\n•	changing of the garb which I mentioned.\r\n\r\nNo, I don’t think so- I don’t think there was anything I didn’t like.\r\n\r\nDid you do a lot of shopping- I didn’t buy a lot of stuff. it’s cheap. Christina. I bought those socks that are funny, fuzzy and low cut and they have B atman or Spiderman. I would say they’re typical Korean characters. world war II propaganda. I didn’t really do the bargaining, Christina didn’t bargain much ‘cause it was hard. \r\n\r\nI liked the fashion, a lot. Every single, no not every single, there are hosts of women wearing scarves and very little- more concerned with fashion… comparing it to, Japan, it’s a little bit more conservative, but in a good way. It’s more, not formal, but—they’re not as trashy as slutty. More sophisticated, more of a sophisticated look, coats, looks more clean instead of spikes and those.\r\n\r\nThey all look similar to each other – Christina.\r\nThat is not true, and that’s not the white person saying that. –Kyle. \r\nI thought it looked nice, I thought it looked clean. \r\nYou don’t think they kind of dressed alike?\r\nThere were trends. \r\n\r\nI know that some times, the social order can be challenging. I had to have seen it there, but I can’t think of anything specific. \r\n\r\nWe drove with an absolutely crazy driver. He would not stop at stop lights he would just drive through them, drive over curbs, and always speeding running red lights. He owned the streets. He was my cousin’s boyfriend, who we met for the first time. They lived very close to the border and he was the driver in Jejudo, the worst driver I’ve met in all of Korea. \r\n\r\nI’d love to go back, and see more of Korea. \r\n\r\nDec 26 2011 to Jan 17 2012. \r\n\r\nKorean drivers in general insane. They drove so close to each other. There’s no place to park they just park on the sidewalk and leave. Amount of people. They’re crazy there. \r\n\r\nAs far as stories, I don’t really think so. Overall, it was fun and I’d like to go back. Food was great. \r\n','','',0,0),(409,44,316,NULL,'Stories of Non-Koreans\' Experiences in Korea #4','Audio','S: Today is Thursday, March 1st at 1PM. I’m here with MF and I’m interviewing her for my Korea183 class: Non-Koreans’ Experiences in Korea. Hello M.\r\nM: Hello. My mouth is full. Can you tell that I’ve been in Korea if I cover my mouth like this? \r\nS: I was just wondering, of all the countries you could go to, why Korea? Was there no choice?\r\nM: It’s kind of not an interesting reason. I had been traveling through Southeast Asia and Tibet and we were planning on going westward toward Georgia and stuff like that, but our plans on getting visas and planes and things totally fell through once we had gotten out of Tibet. So we though, Oh maybe we’ll just go home since we were low on money anyway. So we were heading on the train through China toward the coast where we could catch a plane and we ran into people who told us, Hey you know you could teach English in Asia, right? And we were like, Oh yeah, that would totally get us some money so we started looking into jobs there. And we found out we could make way more money in Korea and we kind of needed the money more than anything so we thought, Hey, why not?\r\nS: Who was ‘we’?\r\nM: Oh so I was with my friend Malcolm.\r\nS: How did you find the job? \r\nM: It was on… I want to say Craigslist, was that even on… this was 2002. But it was some online listing that a lot of teachers used at the time. It was a common way to find teachers and jobs.\r\nS: Where did you work? \r\nM: At a hakwon for kids in Pusan. \r\nS: And how long were you there for?\r\nM: Almost a year. \r\nS: Where did you stay while you were there?\r\nM: They got us an apartment. So most of these foreign contracts, there’s a salary and housing. Which is really good because apparently there is a lot of complications about getting apartments in Korea or Japan. So they provided housing. \r\nS: What was your idea or understanding of Korea before you went?\r\nM: It’s funny, when I think about this and try to remember what I thought before I went there, it’s like I can’t even remember. But I think I knew Korean a little closer. I knew that Korea was part of Northeast Asia and expected it to be more like China or what I knew of Japan than expect it to be more like Thailand or something like that.\r\nS: You’d been to Japan before?\r\nM: I hadn’t, but just by living in western culture you just kind of end up with a lot of exposure to Japanese culture, right?\r\nS: Where are you originally from?\r\nM: Canada.\r\nS: The purpose of this fieldwork project is to collect stories. Do you have any memorable experiences there?\r\nM: Oh yeah, sure. Lots.\r\nS: Or funny things? Or miscommunication?\r\nM: Well, really soon after we started working at our hakwon- the school had a kindergarten attached on the bottom floor, just a regular kindergarten and our floor was English hakwon for kindergarten and also after-school for elementary kids, but it was all owned by the same guy… So really soon after we arrived, there was this festival or something. But we never understood what was going on. Ever. I mean, they did speak English, but it’s like they couldn’t explain it. All the parents came and all the kids came and they were all wearing red shirts. Like Be the Reds shirts, except if they didn’t, they had some other red shirt. And they just did warm-ups. And stretched and stuff like that. And then there were little races with the parents and the kids, mostly the kids. And there was this weird performance where all these kids were wearing sort of fluorescent pink and fluorescent yellow, they looked like pixie costumes, like they were made out of garbage bags. It was more like nylon. The whole time we were just sitting like, What the heck. This is so weird. I mean, it’s fantastic. But what is going on, I don’t understand. \r\nS: So it was like a school event? It wasn’t like an all-Korean event?\r\nM: It was a school event. But we didn’t know what it was for. Or really what we were doing there. We were sort of supervising. But we didn’t really know what we were supervising.\r\nS: That was the only time that it happened?\r\nM: Well, I found that a lot of times traveling, you would be like, I don’t really know what’s going on, but it’s pretty cool. You’d be like, Huh, there seems to be an opera going on in the streets out of nowhere.\r\nS: So it wasn’t like an every week, they would do this?\r\nM: Oh no, no. It was just the once. We should’ve asked when we knew them better, maybe they could’ve explained, I don’t know. Gosh, well we had some really nice travel time. We had vacation over Christmas and New Year’s and we went over to Seoul which was fantastic. We went into a New Year’s downtown near the bell and everything. And I had never been somewhere so crowded before. But it was exciting, not scary. It’s like it’s so crowded that you’re touching people’s chest and back behind you, but it didn’t feel like people were going to stampede or anything crazy. All these fireworks and samul nori troops that go from place to place and stop and play, and we would dance with them. \r\nS: Were other people dancing with them too? Like, everyone was?\r\nM: Yeah. Well, not everybody was, but a bunch of people.\r\nS: Did you ever take part in another tradition or festival?\r\nM: Yeah, a bunch of things. For one thing, there’s this Pusan Buddhism Center and they monthly had an event for foreigners. They do it in English, where they do some traditional Korean thing. Like a traditional Korean craft, like we did calligraphy and we did kite making. And one time there was a kite festival, and then we made kites one month and then the next month we tried to fly them on the beach with everyone else on the beach who was there in Pusan flying kites on the beach. So that was really cool. Also, I studied for taekwondo for a bit. I got a yellow belt. Oh, and I joined a samul nori group, so I played the jangu. And both of those were all in Korean. There was almost no English spoken at all, so it was really confusing all the time, but it was really fun.\r\nS: So you didn’t know any Korean before you went there?\r\nM: No, not a word. We had a phrase book and our phrase book was very good. \r\nS: How did you communicate with people?\r\nM: Well, I mean, in one-on-one situations, usually the person you’re speaking to speaks English and this is part of the reason why I didn’t really learn Korean. But, most of the time there would be English. But we also had a phrase book and phrase books are very helpful. And it’s not like I didn’t learn any Korean at all. There was a lady who ran a vegetable truck on our corner. That’s where I bought almost all my vegetables and she didn’t speak any English. So I learned how to say, How much are the cucumbers this week? Thank you. Oh, can I have some mushrooms. And all that kind of stuff. Um, so yeah, I learned in a very particular context. And of course I learned how to read ‘cause that’s easy. But I don’t understand what I read. I remember one day, I was like, I wonder how you say ‘ice cream’ in Korean. Oh look, there’s an ice cream place… a-i-sŭ-cŭ-rim. And we were like, Oh. \r\nS: A lot of Korean words are actually like that.\r\nM: Yeah.\r\nS: Did you have any negative encounters or experiences with the people there?\r\nM: A few. Not a lot. I generally found Koreans to be very friendly and polite and all those things. There was a guy near the end, soon before I left, I went by myself to Jejudo and I did a bike tour by myself around the outside. I did like four days and it was so nice and slow. Oh, it was fantastic. But this one spot, sometimes the map wasn’t so clear so you have to ask for directions and usually it’s totally fine, safe, and even fun to ask people for directions. So I met this guy on a scooter or a motorbike something, and he was like, Oh you need to go that way. I can show you, so just follow me. So I followed him and it was into the wind so he had to keep waiting for me. Finally, we got to this one spot and he stopped and he took out his penis. \r\nS: What?\r\nM: And I didn’t notice at first. And he was like, Hey. And I was like (shocked face). So I think I swore at him in English and rode away, but I was kind of scared. Like I didn’t know if that meant he wanted to rape me later. He knew where I was going too ‘cause I was like, Well I need to go here eventually so I thought I would try to go this way… \r\nS: And he just left you alone after that?\r\nM: Yeah, he didn’t follow me. Apparently, it’s the case that a lot of flashers, that’s all they want to do. They just want to flash and then that’s it. It’s not really like a threat, they’re just being jerks.\r\nS: Wow, I would not know how to react to that.\r\nM: Well, I ran into some people and I stopped because I was like, Okay people. Safe. You know, they kind of asked me. Somehow it came up that I was concerned and I was worried. And I tried to explain, but they didn’t speak any English and my Korean was so bad. And they were like, What? You have to go to the bathroom? I guess, pointing at my crotch. You have to pee? No, no, nah never mind.\r\nS: Oh wow. How was your experience with the food there?\r\nM: Well, I’m vegetarian which really limited my options. But oh my goodness, it was so good. I even loved going out for… you know when you cook the meat at your table and stuff? Like Korean barbecue. I liked going out for that stuff just because it was fun. I like the chaos and all the stuff that was out on the table and scissors and turning things over and the fire and everything. I couldn’t eat it of course. I would be eating rice or something. Usually I could find something else to eat. But not always. But I liked it anyway, it was just fun. \r\nS: Did people say anything since you were sitting there but not eating?\r\nM: Well I would be out with my colleagues or something. And they already knew I was vegetarian and they always tried to make sure I had something. And they would ask the waiters to bring me food and usually there was something else on the menu. You know how Korean restaurants are sort of like one-menu restaurants. But usually they had bibimbap or something. And you can always have vegetable bibimbap. Oh my favorite was mountain vegetable bibimbap. Sanchae bibimbap and I’ve never seen it outside of Korea of course. You would go outside of the temples and the monks had been collecting mushrooms and greens and stuff like that from the mountains and oh my goodness, it’s fantastic. \r\nS: I really didn’t know that. Did people ever look at you interestingly?\r\nM: Yeah, actually that was the other thing that… Sometimes. Actually at first, we didn’t really notice because we had just come from Tibet and in Tibet, people would literally sit in a circle outside our tent and stare at us and not talk to us and it was really disturbing. So we first got to Korea and wow, no one stares at us. But Pusan, it’s the second biggest city, but it’s still really different from Seoul. Seoul is like its own place. Like while everyone else is much more countryside, even Pusan which is a big city. So we got a lot of stares and people being like, ‘Oh miguk!’ Just kids of course would say that kind of thing. And sometimes I would speak back to them in Korean like, No no, I’m Canadian. But yeah, over time, it became more tiresome, feeling like you couldn’t really walk anywhere without attracting attention. It’s like there’s no privacy. Even if you go walking in the mountains, they just look at you longer. You know, like, That was a surprising a sight… a white person. And they would stop. But sometimes it would be like uohh. But you know. Sometimes people were kind of rudely staring, but most of the time it was more like extra attention just because of the sight.\r\nS: But they would just stare and never approach you?\r\nM: Sometimes people would come and talk to us. But they’re shy. They tend to be very shy.\r\nS: So how many seasons were you there for?\r\nM: Just for one year, so the middle of summer to the early summer next year. \r\nS: So you got to witness a lot of different weather changes in Korea?\r\nM: Yeah, it’s really funny. I noticed that the Koreans and Japanese are really proud of their four seasons. Maybe it’s because a lot of their cultural interactions with countries with three seasons. But it’s completely normal for me to have four seasons. I’m from Canada. But they were very nice. The summer was kind of miserable. But the fall and the spring were really nice. The winter was kind of boring because it doesn’t usually get cold enough to snow. But it did snow. They had gotten the most snow they’ve gotten in twenty years this one day it snowed. It was really exciting because it had been two years since I had lived somewhere with snow.\r\nS: You were saying Koreans and Japanese are very proud of their seasons. Was there anything that led you to that conclusion?\r\nM: Just the way people would talk about it. Like, You know, we have four seasons. I guess, but you get that in Canada too. \r\nS: Do you feel more comfortable interacting with Koreans here more now that you’ve spent time there?\r\nM: Oh yeah, totally. I actually was an English teacher in Vancouver for a year before I came here. I had sort felt like I knew how to interact with Koreans. And Japanese too, because it’s similar culture, but especially the Koreans. Like I have trouble with my own culture, because no one ever taught me. But you know, for Koreans, my phrase book says, my guide book says I should behave this way. And then I practiced and learned and yeah that worked well. So I had instructions and knew how to behave.\r\nS: What are some things you felt like you had to change or you had to be more cautious or aware of when interacting with Koreans?\r\nM: I learned something about group dynamics and I’m sure this is probably true here, but it’s less overtly true. I can’t remember the word, but there’s actually a word. Something like group spirit. Something like that in Korean. And it’s really important. Like if you have positive group spirit, then everyone’s happy. And if you have negative group spirit, then everyone gets miserable. Obviously, you can have positive group spirit and some people can be unhappy or something, but a negative atmosphere can really bring people down quick a lot. So as a teacher, it was part of my job to keep the spirit of the classroom up. I didn’t always know how to do that. I had never been in front of a group of people before. Trying to learn that, I made mistakes for sure. That was interesting. I think one thing that’s always hard for me is that I guess as a Canadian, I’m just sort of honest and blunt in a lot of ways. But in Korea, it’s more important, or you put more value on, sort of keeping the peace than on honesty. And in every culture, they think both the things are important, but some cultures think that one is more important than the other. And I’m used to putting more emphasis on honesty and less honesty on keeping the peace. Especially if the person I’m talking to is someone of higher status as me so I sort of had to like pretend I didn’t think my boss was a jerk when he actually was a jerk. But that did end up being that he had stolen money from us at the end. Yeah, he was embezzling tax money from us. Yeah, but it’s really hard to do anything about it because everything and everyone’s smiley and pleasant and you don’t want to disrupt. It was a fair bit of money for us.\r\nS: And everyone knew about this?\r\nM: No, but we didn’t realize this until the end when it was time to leave. We were like, Oh, we need tax forms. And he was like, Oh sure I’ll get that for you. And he never talked about it again and kind of avoided us. \r\nS: How was shopping in Korea?\r\nM: Well, we’d already gotten quite good at bargaining. We had pretty much sucked when we first got to Thailand, but by the time we left China, the Chinese were like, How did you get that price? I can’t get that price! In Korea, the bargaining is not that strong. In China, you’re aiming for somewhere about 50% the asking price. They say 100 and you say no, 20! And then you both laugh. But in Korea, it’s more of an 80 to 90%. We didn’t buy very much. Except for food. Which we bought mainly from our vegetable lady and our Lotte Mart. \r\nS: Do you have any other stories that you want to share?\r\nM: You know, the north is really beautiful there. On our Christmas vacation, after Seoul, we went to Sŏraksan, which you means ‘snow, craggy mountain.’ And mountains are just vertical, skinny vertical things. And there were tons of snow, I was so happy. It was really beautiful, so that was possible the best thing.\r\nS: How did you travel everywhere?\r\nM: Mostly by train. And Korean trains were just great. Really nice.\r\n\r\nOh yeah! On Jejudo, by then I had already spoken a little bit of Korean, I could say some small things. But on Jejudo, they don’t have much vegetarian foods. Usually the restaurants have their menus written on the window, so I’d go to the window and it’d say, “hoe” which means sashimi. And I’d be like, no. And then it says, “tang,” really gross meaty soup. And I’m like, no. And that’s all I could find in every restaurant. And finally, there’s this one place that says “kimbap” and you can always get vegetarian kimbap and since they roll it right in front of you, you can just tell them, Don’t put in any ham and don’t put any fish in it or anything else that you were going to put in it that isn’t vegetarian. So, I went in there, and I asked her in Korean if I could have vegetarian kimbap. She’s like, What do you mean? And I say, no koki. Like the general word meaning meat-eating flesh. And she said, Okay. No mulkoki. And I was like, Right. And no ham. And she’s like, Ham? Ham is not koki. And I say, yes it is. And like I told you, you’re not supposed to be honest. You’re supposed to be polite and I kind of forgot this. And I said, yes it is. It’s ham. It’s made of pigs. And I say, Yeah, ham is koki. And she says, No ham is not koki! And I tell her, Yes it is! And then finally I was like, Wait a minute what am I doing? Okay whatever. Ham is koki, can I please have it with no ham and no fish? And she said no.\r\nS: She said no?\r\nM: She said no! I think she was mad at me because I argued with her because she was older than me. She just wouldn’t do it so I had to leave. \r\nS: Did you get to eat at all?\r\nM: Yeah, I don’t quite remember what I found. \r\n','meaghan fowlie k183.mp3','audio/mpeg',22277142,1981379),(410,44,317,NULL,'Stories of Non-Koreans\' Experiences in Korea #5','Audio','S: My name is SC and it’s 3:16 PM on Tuesday March 13. I’m here interviewing F for my Korean fieldwork project assignment. So my topic is stories of non-Koreans’ experiences in Korea. And I noticed from class discussions, you had a lot of stories and experiences to share. I was just wondering, of all of the countries, how did you get started interested in Korea?\r\n\r\nF: Actually, my first knowledge of Korea was my sister’s best friend growing up was Korean-American. And her mom was from Korea, so we used to go over all the time and then after that, oddly enough, my first girlfriend was Korean. So that was another way in. And then I started studying Buddhism and Korea is known for its very old Buddhist origin. \r\n\r\nS: Are you Buddhist?\r\n\r\nF: I’m not a Buddhist.\r\nS: So you’re just studying it?\r\nF: I was there studying Buddhism in Korea.\r\nS: So how did you get the opportunity to go to Korea?\r\nF: It was because I was going to study to be a monk. I was going to be a monk, basically. So they take care of everything.\r\nS: When was this?\r\nF: This was in 1995. So I was a professional and gave away everything and went to Korea to be a monk.\r\nS: And you were staying in a monastery?\r\nF: Yup,  monasteries and temples.\r\nS: Where were these?\r\nF: Most of the ones that I stayed in were in the cities. So I stayed in Iksan, which used to be called Irisi. And then I was in Seoul for several years. And then I was in the country side off and on the whole time.\r\nS: Do you have any interesting stories to share about your time spent in Korea?\r\nF: I have lots of stories to share. I mean, is there anything particular you want me to share?\r\nS: I guess something that sticks out to you that kind of defines your experience in Korea?\r\nF: I would say, I could share a story that was very similar to what we’ve talked about in class. I lived in the country side. In yongkwangkung. Which is in Jŏllado. It’s a very small farming village. It’s a village not a town. Along the coast in the mountains, and I was living in the monastery there and the temple. And at the same time, we had to work on the farms. But the farms were mostly run by local people. They were the ones doing all the farming, and they worked the land that the temple owned also. So the monks, we would go out and help them during harvest and various times of the year. But because of that, I also got to know some of the local people there. It may be because I was a foreigner, I’m not sure. But I kind of got invited to a bonfire. It was basically, it wasn’t a full-on mask dance, but it was sort of a storytelling person sitting around a fire doing the same thing. It was like a mask dance type thing touring little troupe. So I got to do that and none of the other monks were there, just me. I snuck out. In a way. And I went, so it was just very interesting because I found it very interesting. The people in the country side were very different from the people in the city.\r\nS: How so?\r\nF: They seemed a lot warmer and receptive and kind of having that maybe, stereotypical kind of Korean hospitality that I think is idealized. And you were just part of the group, and actually it was more surprising because the women that were there seemed to be more of the dominant force than what’s put forward in popular culture about the men being in control. At this particular event, it seemed like women were.\r\nS: Just at the event?\r\nF: At that and also in general, life in the countryside. It seemed like women were more in control than the men, and maybe it’s because they did all the work.\r\nS: How did you learn the language before going?\r\nF: I didn’t. So when I first got there, I had to go to a language school for a year while living in a temple. So I first lived with Koreans without knowing any Korean. \r\nS: How did you communicate?\r\nF: Hand gestures. There wasn’t much to say in a monastery. It was pretty easy. Life in the temple is pretty regimented so there were chores that I needed to do. Once those kinds of things were communicated, over time while I slowly spoke more and more.\r\nS: Were there a lot of non-Koreans there at the monastery?\r\nF: No, there were none. Just me.\r\nS: Do you feel like people treated you any different because of that?\r\nF: Yes. \r\nS: How so?\r\nF: Well, within the Buddhist context, I think since I was the first one to come to the order, there was maybe some privileging. Or an elevation in status a little bit, with the Koreans. So I tended to get to meet with people or have audiences of people that were younger people, but they wouldn’t give the time to them. Because it’s very hierarchical. The older you get, the more you tend to associate with kind of age range or status level. So there was definitely. \r\nS: Did you say how long you were there for?\r\nF: I was there for five years. \r\nS: And have you ever gone back since then?\r\nF: Yeah. Many times. I haven’t in the last six or seven years.\r\nS: Are you a grad student in the Korean studies program?\r\nF: Yes.\r\nS: Is there a specific concentration?\r\nF: Yes, I’m doing Korean religious history. So I already have my masters from Columbia in Korean history. So now I’m doing more specifically Korean religious history.\r\nS: How did you like the food?\r\nF: I loved the food. Actually, I still… I just bought kimchi the other day. I brought the ones, I don’t know if you remember, but at the buffet we had, I brought the little fish. The very Korean. I thought all the old people would like, but wasn’t sure if the younger ones would. So I loved Korean food, I had no problem with it actually. And I personally think that was one reason why I was received so well. Because they always expected me to not like the food. I guess they’re used to foreigners not liking Korean food. Or finding it too spicy or something. But I didn’t think it was spicy at all. Especially if you’re used to South American or Central American dishes. \r\nS: Do they comment on that?\r\nF: Oh yeah, they would comment on that all the time. I usually got that my jonseng, my previous life, I was Korean. That’s usually what they said. “Jonsengi hanguk saramiyah or yutdah.”\r\nS: So you were received pretty well by the people there that you met. Was there any negative experience there that you had?\r\nF: Yeah, there were negative experiences. Most of them revolved around gender disparity. Just so for myself, I came from a family that was more matriarchal than patriarchal, where the head of the family was the woman. So it was difficult because once I got in more intimate relations with Koreans, to be around men. When certain attitudes were being thrown about at a woman or a man would inadvertently gesture or say or do something that was dismissive of the woman, I didn’t take that very well. So I would sometimes say things that I probably shouldn’t have said at the time.\r\nS: How did they respond to that?\r\nF: Not very well. Usually, they were embarrassed. Usually, they were very embarrassed.\r\nS: How could you tell?\r\nF: Some men, they would get angry. I had a couple guys fight at me saying like, Stupid Americans and stuff like that. Usually, funny enough, the women seem to like it. So I was very close with a lot of the women there. And the men of course did not like that. Because they thought it was challenging their authority or something. But a lot of times, I thought they were embarrassed too because I think they realized that what they were doing at the moment. Maybe they had kind of mindlessly said something or done something, and when they think about it, I find most Koreans to be somewhat self-reflective, so they would.. I don’t know what they were thinking, but I could see that there was a sense of embarrassment, from either embarrassing themselves or just in front of a foreigner. \r\nS: What did you usually talk about with strangers or people you just met? What was small talk like?\r\nF: Well for foreigners, it’s almost always food. It’s usually food. And for my situation, a lot of the small talk was about monastery life. Usually it was food or the way I looked like, Americans have such big eyes. Standard things, nothing very unusual. A lot of stuff about the weather.\r\nS: How did you like the weather?\r\nF: It was hot. But some of my family’s from Missouri and Mississippi so it was very similar. Very hot and humid and cold and dreary in the winter. I think that’s why my personal experiences in life resonated with life in Korea. Just the environment. I’m from an Italian background so family’s extremely important. It’s no different from a Korean family. It’s absolutely, it’s actually identical. Even down to the privileging of the oldest son. It’s almost identical. So a lot of the things, I just had an affinity with and it just felt very natural. I didn’t find it to be much different, which was eye-opening in itself. \r\nS: Did you have instances where because of the language barrier, you completely misunderstood something someone was saying?\r\nF: So many, I can’t remember specifics off the top of my head. When I was in the Buddhist order that I was studying, it’s not prohibited that you drink wine. They basically say, a glass here and there is not a big deal if you’re out to dinner with people. I didn’t know that and I thought I had heard that you weren’t supposed to drink at all. So it said refrain, and I had heard it as don’t do. So we went out one time, and there were some nuns, and one of the older nuns ordered wine. And I thought, wow she’s cool. She’s drinking wine in public with all these people. I asked later and they explained.\r\nS: What did you think of the drinking culture there?\r\nF: It was heavy. And the smoking. From 95 to 2000. I heard it’s pretty much the same still, but everywhere people were drinking and smoking. Like smoking in the buildings. Whereas, by then, you couldn’t smoke in an office building here. And the drinking culture was very heavy, especially for the men. I met some women who would drink every now and then, but usually it was just the men. And you know, you had to do it. Like if a sunbae invites you out. Even though the order I was studying at, you were on and off three months at a time. So during my off time, I was usually in Seoul. And during that time, a lot of it was spent drinking with Koreans. \r\nS: How did you meet those Koreans during your stay in the city?\r\nF: Usually through friends, or friends of friends.\r\nS: You said you were already exposed to Korean culture, but did you have certain expectations going to Korea that were or weren’t met?\r\nF: I think the biggest one, not specifically about Korea, but because I was going to study Buddhism, I expected a specific lifestyle and discipline from everyone in the order. And then, everyone that studies religion, when you get there, you find out these are just normal people. There’s nothing particularly spectacular about each individual monk. As a group, it’s what they’re doing, but individually, they’re like everyone else. They’re watching TV, they’re sitting around, they’re not doing what they’re supposed to be doing, they’re either laughing or crying. I don’t know if it was specifically Korean thing, but it was through Korea, it opened me up to that idea that monks were normal people too. They’re just like everyone else.\r\nS: Do you have any funny story that you remember? \r\nF: I have some funny taxi stories. Oh, I have a really good one. It’s kind of funny and at the same time it’s kind of disturbing. A lot of times when you’re in a country like Korea, or Japan, or China, where learning the language is extremely difficult, they immediately assume you can’t speak it. Immediately. It doesn’t even cross their mind that you might know how to speak Korean. It’s just, you don’t know. So a lot of times, they’ll just start speaking things about you or talk about you or talk about foreigners right in front of you. They don’t think that you know. One time when I was on the subway, there was a man who looked a little off. Maybe mentally. And I was standing on the subway and it was very packed. He was ranting to anyone around, no one was really listening, about Americans and foreigners and how they’re all taking over and ruining our culture. And he was saying all of this stuff that, even other people could tell that this was inappropriate. I didn’t say anything, I understood everything he was saying. Like every word since I had been in Korea for a while. So my stop was coming up so I just looked up at him in Korean very slow, “You know, you should be careful because all the foreigners in Seoul speak Korean. We just don’t tell anyone because we all work for the government.” And I was saying it in Korean, “We’re all spies and we work for the government and we understand everything you’re saying.” And he froze, but you could tell that some of the women around. And there was a woman around who I could tell was sort of bothered, but when I said it, she was probably one of the only people that heard, she just got this big smile on her face like, you’re messing with them. She’s trying not to laugh. Stuff like that was usually funny. Or I thought it was funny.\r\nS: What do you think was the most difficult thing about adjusting to Korean life?\r\nF: So I was living in a monastery, and I was used to here, where the men were just a little more self-sufficient in our culture. They can usually do things, clean, do their laundry and stuff. It was very difficult to go from this world and be transplanted in a world that isn’t only different, but thrust into a male-centered world for a while because I was in a male monastery. So I was surrounded by only Korean men. And I’m not used to that ever. Even in the United States. That was very difficult because I felt that so many of them had been locked into the hierarchical order that they weren’t maybe questioning things that they should’ve questioned. It was so rigid and so unforgiving in a way. And I realized how dependent they were on the women. These men couldn’t do anything. About all they could do was boil water for ramen and maybe hand-wash some socks. Other than that, as men, I found them to be overly-dependent on women. It made me change my perspective on women a lot because I saw the real power that they do have. Whereas they’re projected as weak and docile, and I’m like, there’s no way that’s possible because the men are so dependent on them. The only thing the men do is go to work and come home. Maybe go out drinking afterwards. But as far as everything that has to do with family life, it’s almost all organized and taken care of by the mothers. Everything from the education of their children. They might both decide together, or the husband might decide on his own, but the person that gets it done is the wife. Or the wife and her friends. Or her church community or something like that. The hardest thing, I think, was interacting with Korean men that were my age. It was extremely difficult. 25, 30 years old in Korea is a lot different than being 25 and 30 in the United States. It’s just different. You’re still at home, you’re still being taken care of by your parents and I couldn’t relate. I think that was the hardest thing, and that was eventually what led me to leave Korea. It was just the gender disparity. I couldn’t handle it after a while, it just got to me. But I mean, I understood it in the context. I was trying not to judge, of course, but it was because I was in a hyper-masculine environment with no women. At that time. At first, I lived with nuns at temples. But my last year or so was just in this male monastery and it was just a bit too much for me. That was probably the most difficult. \r\nS: You were talking about hierarchy. How did that show? Was it mainly through their language?\r\nF: Through everything. Well, the language part, I was often given slack on. It was just very hard for me to transition to jondaetmal. Especially if the man was only a few years older than me or even five or six years older than me. I didn’t feel the need to do it, I didn’t feel that he deserved it for any particular reason. So it was very hard for me to switch into it. I had many situations where it didn’t go well, it went very bad. Where you have someone who’s a few years older than me almost order me around. And it didn’t go very well.\r\nS: So there were no exceptions made for you.\r\nF: Sometimes there was. Often. But once I got into the tighter unit of the monastery itself. Temples are a little more relaxed because you could live in a temple or a monastery. Monasteries are a little more structured. So in the temple structure, you have a different group dynamic. There’s a lot more people so maybe they felt the need to establish some order. I was the new person coming in so I was expected to be… I don’t mind being told what to do, but I don’t like to be ordered to do. Even the lowly things, I don’t mind, but I don’t like being ordered or told. Or if I had a problem with something, I didn’t like that just because I was told to do it, I had to do it. Not because there’s a reason. Dealing with the men because I didn’t come from that family background. \r\nS: What did your regular day consist of?\r\nF: It was the same whether I was I in a temple or a monastery. Usually for the first three years, I would get up around 4:30AM and meditate for an hour or hour and a half, and clean the temple or outside, then usually when I was in the city, I would leave immediately and go to school. I studied at Sokang University, near Yonsei. I would get up and go to school to study and would come back and study some more and studying was a very big thing in Korea so I got lots of time to study. And then we would have an evening meditation and chant. And then go to bed. That regimented lifestyle pretty much stayed the same. Occasionally on the weekends, I would go out or something. But most of my time I spent studying because that’s what I was there to do and I didn’t have an education when I got there, so I was very inspired by the Korean passion for education. And that’s actually why I’m here now. I don’t think I would’ve gotten here had I not gone to Korea. At all. I had never been in a culture that valued education and teachers. So highly. I had never experienced that before, where it was an honor to be a teacher.\r\nS: How did you learn that?\r\nF: I don’t think you can get away from it there. The suicides are a telling situation, but that’s an extreme. But I mean, it’s hard to escape in Korea. It’s cultural, historical, it goes back so far, thousands of years. It wasn’t that it was just important, but that it was respected and this is what you do. You learn. When you’re young. And it doesn’t just teach you stuff, but it helps you to become a better person. Which we have here, but it’s not to the extreme. But to watch parents in Korea just do everything they can do to make sure they have the money to support their children’s educations. To me, that was awe-inspiring because my family didn’t do that. My family would say, pay for it yourself. A lot of Americans are like that, they don’t do that for their family. That sacrifice they made was very impressive and touching to me. And they were doing that to me, because they were taking me in as their family. They were doing everything possible to let me study. If that meant time, whatever, I was given exceptions because I was learning a foreign language. Anything I needed in that realm, they kind of accommodated for. And they paid for me to go to these schools, so it was touching. So that’s why the first thing I thought of when I came back, I have to go to school. \r\nS: So were you living in California when you came back from Korea?\r\nF: No, most of my family lives in Denver, Colorado. I had been living abroad for so long that when I came back, I didn’t have enough residency anywhere. So anywhere I had gone I would’ve had to pay out of state, unless it was there. So I could go back to Denver and start right away. And when I was done with Denver, I left. \r\nS: So was there kind of a culture shock coming back from Korea?\r\nF: Oh yeah. I would say that the first thing I noticed was how unhealthy the average American is. And how fat they are. I was there for five years and at that time in the 90s, the stuff was just starting to get into the public eye- that people are starting to get big. But by 2000 and 2005, we’re hitting huge percentages. I think that was the biggest culture shock. Because I was mainly traveling in Asia and Africa and stuff. And just watching how what seems to me now American children are somewhat spoiled compared to Koreans. For instance, in public schools, I have a lot of friends who are teaching who can’t even say anything anymore. There’s this weird over-attitude in America that the kid seems to rule the family more than the parents. Granted, I wouldn’t want to be in a family that was as rigorously disciplined as some of the Korean families. We have families like that here too in America. But it just seems like maybe there’s a median point somewhere in between where you get something that’s stripped and it’s laid down. These are the things that you’re supposed to be doing right now and we’re here to make sure you’re prepared. Whereas, it’s kind of like, Ah… I don’t know, I just don’t know. There seems to be less discipline and the kids are more ready to just say and do things that they wouldn’t do if they were a little more disciplined. That’s just my opinion. Those were the two that was the biggest culture shock because I noticed how well-mannered the average Korean kid was and how they have a work-hard, go-getting attitude. Of course I saw people who were not. But everywhere you go… but in general, I thought I saw more parents that were concerned with their kids’ future than worrying about them being happy right now. They weren’t worried about pleasing them, they were very willing to say no. Very ready to say no. And you need that, you need to say that to your children a lot. Or else you get children who are completely out of control.\r\nS: So are there a lot of interaction with Korean-Americans here?\r\nF: Yes, of course. Half my friends are Korean now and I’m part of the Korean Studies department so I meet a lot of Koreans. I also meet a lot of non-Korean friends who can speak Korean or read and write Korean and they hardly have any experience in Korea. I think we fit in our own little part of the Korean sphere. Because we’re not really insiders. But we’re not really outsiders because we can speak Korean, so you’re immediately brought in to a certain degree. Just the other day, I was walking around looking for a place to buy banchan and I have just recently moved here and I hadn’t gone to Koreatown that much. So I was wandering around K-town and I kind of zoned in on an old lady and I thought, Old ladies know where the food is. And I saw this really, really old lady and I stopped her. It was funny because I was speaking Korean to her, but she kept saying, “Mollayo, mollayo.” And then I finally said, “Halmŏni, Hangukmallo yaeki hako isŭbnidah” and she just looked at me and she had thought I was speaking English to her so she just was saying “mollayo mollayo” and as soon as I actually stopped her for a second and said, I’m speaking Korean, she was like, Oh! And I asked her, Where can I buy some banchan? I want some masitnŭn banchan, and she just lit up and said, Ohhh and was pointing around where to go. There’s always that little bit of distance, particularly in older Koreans. You have to really lay it out like, I speak Korean. Otherwise, they’re like, I don’t want to talk to you.\r\nS: Why do you think that is?\r\nF: Well she was really short. And here’s this tall tattooed guy leaning over her and she was at least a little intimidated for sure. And I guess she was just assuming I spoke English since… it was so common even in Korea too. I would start speaking Korean and they don’t understand what I’m saying and I know my pronunciation is right on. And they still don’t hear it until a few minutes go by and they’re like, Ohh, you’re speaking Korean, I thought you were speaking English. \r\n','frederik.mp4','video/mp4',7019369,1981920),(412,38,55,290,'Making Gujeolpan','Audio','According to my mom, Gujeolpan is a food that you can eat when you have no appetite with some Korean mustard. It is a very healthy food item because it is made with various different ingredients. Gujeolpan is made with beef, shiitake mushrooms, eggs, shrimp, cucumbers, carrots, and any other left over fresh vegetables. Cut all the ingredients into slices, and fry the beef and shiitake mushrooms. You want to separate the yolk and the egg white to fry them, and cut them into slices. Blanch the shrimp and get rid of the shell. Other vegetables need to be cut slices and fried with salt. All of the different vegetables, meats, and eggs need to be placed on a dish with eight sections and a center section. The white radish needs to be cut into slices in a pancake shape, salt and vinegar down pickle, and then place in the center while the other various food items need to be placed categorically into the other sections. When you eat, you can wrap the various food items into the pancake and eat with the mustard sauce. It usually takes over an hour to prepare this dish. She said that usually people use wheat flour to make the pancake shaped slices, but my mom prefers to use white radish for better taste and texture. Like Jeonjubibimbap from the above, Gujeolpan is healthy because it has various different ingredients. Historically, my mother informed me that Gujeolpan was served to Korean kings during the dynasty era of Korean history.','???.m4a','audio/x-m4a',1701877,1146652),(413,43,320,289,'Shadows of the Korean War','Audio','February 14, 2012 - Interview (Han Esther)\r\n\r\nIn my interview with Ms. Han, I was told she was located in Kyonggi-do, Angsong on the first day the Korean war occurred. Before the war had actually begun, Mrs. Han’s father served as a high ranking official and judge in the local court. He assumed this position within a short span of 4 months and was given the privilege of accessing undisclosed government information. Through this, Mrs. Han’s family was notified in advance of the oncoming attacks and quickly fled to seek refuge. Before any military presence could reach the city of Angsong, her and her family were able to move to the province of Taegu. This meant that there were no forms of direct contact or interaction between Mrs. Han and the enemy or Western soldiers. She expressed being “highly unaware of the pain and suffering of war” because she was able to escape in advance.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching Taegu, Mrs. Han and her family experienced no difficulties in their supply of food. They were able to cook as normal and received outside sources of help. Because Mrs. Han’s brother in law was a high ranking military officer, after moving from Taejun to Pusan, her family was placed in a refuge specifically for army families. They stayed there 10 days and were surrounded by sickness, disease, and death. Unable to stay in such an environment, Mrs. Han and her family quickly moved to an outside estate, where they paid rent separately to a private land owner. This would be their temporary home for one entire year. \r\n\r\nBecause the Communists, called the “reds,” did not come to Pusan, they were able to lead daily lives of stability. It was a year without trouble and a relatively peaceful stay. Her father returned to his work in the courthouse and her family was safe and sound. Mrs. Han’s family members, comprised of several military officials, stayed with them in Pusan and provided protection and assistance in the domestic sphere. Because of this, she did not experience any suffering except fear when the Korean border was pushed further South.\r\n\r\nWhen the military of North Korea and China combined to push the Korean border, the American soldiers were of great help to the South Korean people. Mrs. Han and her family were able to return to their hometown with the help of the American military, but upon arrival, she could not recognize a thing. The city was completely demolished and both the land and the people were destroyed. Shortly after that, the Communist forces began to push the citizens further South. Mrs. Han and her family quickly escaped to Taegu once again, and it was during the constant pursuit of safety which she felt the most fear. \r\n\r\nHowever, as political discourse began to peak, she was unable to realize the full extent of the war’s atrocities. Because her family would quickly migrate as soon as her brother in law told them to “move,” they simply followed orders and escaped from place to place. She had moved from Angsong to Taegu to Pusan, and finally returned to Taegu. There she was able to attend school in peace and live a comfortable life. When questioned about the most prominent memory of the war, Mrs. Han replied, “To be honest, I did not experience any extreme suffering and thus I cannot give you an answer.” The feelings she remembered during the war, however, were of a constant struggle to survive. Throwing fear and sadness aside, Mrs. Han stated the main emotion she felt was the penetrating “need to live.” It was this constant necessity to stay alive which dictated their everyday actions and caused them to move from place to place. Her time during the war was characterized by an unceasing escape to safety, and all she could think about was making it out of the war. Despite this, however, Mrs. Han did not experience the same level of extreme suffering as others during the war as a result of the political and military ties in her family.\r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁하는날에 어디에 계셨어요?\r\nA: 안성에 있었어. 경기도 안성. \r\n\r\nQ: 육이오때 뭐하고 계셧어요?\r\nA: 안성에서 4월만에 우리 아버지가 그때 판사였거든. 어, 그래서 우리가 피난을 갔어요. 빨리 피하라고 그래서. 우리는, 그러니까, 이민군을 못봤어. 이민군이 안성으로 오기전에 우리는 피난을 갔다고. 대구로. 그래서, 전쟁에 그 진짜 아픔을 잘 몰라. \r\n\r\nQ: 그 대신에 음식은 어떻게 해결하셨어요?\r\nA: 우린 음식은 그냥 해 먹었지, 뭐. 처음에는, 저기, 우리가 부산으로 가가지고. 아니, 아무튼, 스토리가 좀 복잡해. 왜냐면 우리 형부가 군인이였었어. 그래 갖고 장교였거든. 그래서 대전으로 처음에 피난 갔다가 대전에서 부산으로 군인 갖고 수향소 - 응, 거기서 10일동안 있었어. 10일동안 있었는데 다들 병나고 그래가지고 우리는 저기 부산에서 따로 방을 얻어서 거기에 있었어. \r\n\r\nQ: 얼마동안이나 계셨어요 부산에서?\r\nA: 부산에서 1년 넘게 있었지. \r\n\r\nQ: 그럼 바깥에 나가기 쉬웠어요, 아니면 무서웠어요?\r\nA: 부산에? 부산에는 빨갱이들이 안왔으니깐 우리는 괜찮았지. 부산에서는 잘 있었지. 아버지는 다시 법원에서 가시고, 우리 집엔 군인 가족들이 많으니까 우리를 지켜줬어. 그래서 별로 고생을 안했는데, 그때. 그러니까. 육이오 났을때 일사후테가 말이다..\r\n\r\nQ: 일사후테가 뭐였어요?\r\nA: 중국이랑 북한 군인들이 내려왔지. 그때 미국사람들이 우리를 도와줬어. 그래서 우리가 안성으로 다시 돌아갔는데, 가보니깐 엉망징찬이였어. 근데 또 일사후테가 또 났어. 그래서 또 대구로 피난 갔어. 일사후테라는게 1월 14일에 막 쳐 내려왔을때. 중국놈들하고 빨갱이들하고 합쳤어. \r\n\r\nQ: 그럼 전쟁이 더 커졌겠네요?\r\nA: 그런데 우리는 몰라 그걸. 미리 미리 형부가 말이지, “옮겨라” 하면 옮겼으니까. 그래가지고 우리는 대구로 갔어, 대구. 안성에서 대구에서 부산으로. 그때 대한민국 군대가 다 대구로 안전하게 피난 갔을때였다고. 그래서 우리도 대구로 갔지. 대구로 가서 그냥 학교도 댕기고 살았지. \r\n\r\nQ: 그럼 전쟁을 통해서 어떤 기억이 있어요? 전쟁은 어떤거라고 생각해요?\r\nA: 근데, 나는 솔직히 말해서, 그 아주 고통스러운걸 안당해서 뭐라고 할수가 없어요.\r\n\r\nQ: 그럼 전쟁중에 느낌같은거는요? 사람은 전쟁이 나면 어떤 공포와 기분을 느끼나? \r\nA: 그런거 따로 없지. 그냥 살아야 된다는 이름으로 안전한데로 옮기고 옮기고 그랬었지. 피난, 피난. 피난가고. 항상 안전한 곳으로 옮기면서, 살고싶다는것 밖에 생각할수 없었어. \r\n\r\nQ: 혹시 적군과 마주한적 있나요?\r\nA: 한번도 마주친 적이 없엇어요. 우린 미리 미리 피난을 갔기때문에. 그래서 나는 진짜 잘 몰라. 우리 할아버지가 좀 많이 당했더라고. \r\n\r\nQ: 사람들을 통해서 전쟁의 고통스러운 기억을 알고싶었어요. \r\nA: 나느 별로 도움이 안될거야. 고생을 안해봤거든. \r\n\r\nQ: 시간을 내줘서 감사합니다. \r\nA: 할아버지는 주무시니깐 방금 깨울게. \r\n','816780 - 01 (Han Esther).mp3','audio/mp3',8820879,1149297),(414,43,321,289,'Shadows of the Korean War','Audio','February 14, 2012 - Interview (Han Bum Soo)\r\n\r\nOn the day of the war, Mr. Han was sleeping at his home in Seoul. He had been a student in school before the war had begun. While he was in his sleep, in the early hours of morning, Mr. Han suddenly heard and felt something like an earthquake. He quickly turned on the radio and there was a broadcast announcing that the war had begun. The North Koreans had cut off the Hangang river and fear struck everyone in his hometown. As soon as they heard the announcement, chaos ensued within the town. Nobody knew where to go and consequently felt an extreme horror and fear at being helpless and without any knowledge of their future. Mr. Han and his family rushed outside to the streets, unable to bring anything with them. They were shocked to see the streets packed with citizens crying and screaming, looking for their young kids and family. It was pure insanity and the streets were a complete frenzied mess. But according to Mr. Han, “that is the reality of war.” \r\n\r\nThe Korean war began on the 25th of June, and Mr. Han and his family escaped for refuge on the 28th. Traveling with his cousins and immediate family, they could not find any peace of mind throughout their journey. They did not have much money to begin with, so Mr. Han was only able to bring the little money he had with him. However, most of the townspeople considered themselves to be “doomed, already dead,” so what they brought with them was not of great importance at the time. Mr. Han fled to Pyongtaek within a day on foot. The war began on the 25th of June at 3 AM, and the Communists arrived on the 28th in Seoul. They created a blockade at the Hangang river and bombed the area, so they were unable to go near the “one leg” of the Hangang at the time. \r\n\r\nWhen asked about the most difficult memory of the war, Mr. Han’s shouted and scoffed at the same time. “How can you even narrow it down to a single memory? The war itself was painful! Everyone considered themselves dead.” However, the most frightening experience was the very beginning of the war. At 3:20 in the morning, Mr. Han felt his entire house and neighborhood shaking, and when his family ran outside to the streets, the villagers were screaming out “who is there to blame? Who is the cause of this?! Who can tell me where to go?” All of his neighbors seemed to be desperately searching for someone who could provide them with these answers. \r\n\r\nMr. Han continued to flee from place to place, and he was finally able to find peace through the help of the UN soldiers. When the UN military arrived at Incheon, they helped the Korean cause and saved the lives of the South Koreans. According to Mr. Han, the UN soldiers were merciful enough to release some of the North Koreans who deserved pity and grace. After seeking refuge for 3 entire months, Mr. Han decided to join the military effort. He was 20 years old at the time, “60 years before now.” The only contact Mr. Han had with the opposition was through the North Korean civilians who fled South to escape the war. Any other contact with the enemy, however, was a ridiculous suggestion. At the time of the war, the only things the soldiers could think about were killing “those damn bastards,” not making conversation with them. \r\n\r\nAfter the Korean war ended, everything in korea changed. The public sentiment had changed entirely, and if it hadn’t been for the UN soldiers, Korea would have become entirely communist. They would not have had any choice, and thus, the United States is “an extremely great nation. And this is because they saved us from that fate. Do you know what the UN is? All nations are registered as part of the UN. They were the exact reason why we were able to end this 3 year war.” Mr. Han described his post-war feelings as simply inexplicable. At the time, all Korean citizens believed they were already dead, and thus they began to live their lives with a feeling of rebirth and vitality. The fact that they were alive was considered a miracle, and thus it was a divine, unbelievable feeling that the war was finally over. When the war had actually occured, the South Korean soldiers were sent on a vacation. Aside from a couple of soldiers, a few remained, but the rest were missing in action. How was Korea to prepare for such an attack?\r\n\r\nMr. Han was able to support himself during the war through his family’s agricultural property. As the son of a farmer, he had access to rice and fields of grains. During the actual war, Mr. Han lost the close cousin of his mom’s side, who was dragged by North Koreans and forced to participate in the war. Mr. Han’s family was never able to find out the exact story of how his cousin was taken, and it saddens them that they have no information. In the words of Mr. Han, in order to avoid such a devastating event such as war, Korea must live “with their wits about them.” Mr. Han believes that after the war, many spies and Communists have infiltrated South Korea and the government is completely unaware to this fact. According to Mr. Han, this is the greatest problem of Korea in the context of modern times. Korea is blinded to who its friends and enemies are, and cannot tell the difference between who is of help or not. In order to avoid future wars and conflicts, Korea must get itself together and take an active role in filtering out their enemies.\r\n\r\nQ: 육이오 전쟁 났을때 어디에 계셨어요? \r\nA: 서울에 있었어요. 학교 다니느라고. \r\n\r\nQ: 집에 있었어요 아니면 어디에 있었어요?\r\nA: 전쟁이 시작한 날에는 집에 있었어요. 새벽에 그 전쟁이 시작했고, 난 자고 있었어요.\r\n\r\nQ: 자고 있는데 갑작이 어떤소리 들으셨어요?\r\nA: 난리 났었지, 뭐. 지진 난것처럼 들었어요\r\n\r\nQ: 혹시나 그날 테레비나 라디오 들어셨어요? \r\nA: 네 .방송을 했어요 전쟁햇다고.  자던 중인데 그런 문제가 나왔기 때문에 한강을 막히는 순간이였기때문에 난리가 났었죠. 어디로 가야될지 몰라서 겁이 났었죠. 아무것도 가져나오질 못하고 도망가니까 길이 아주 그냥꽉 찼어요. 사람들이. 길바닥이 완전 꽉 찼어. 맨발로 뛰어갔는데 난리가 났었죠. 애들, 아기들, 가족 찾느라고 난리야. 엉망진창이였지. 그게 전젱이지, 뭐. 정신이 하나도 없었어요. \r\n\r\nQ: 그럼 피난 갈 준비 하셨나요? 피난은 어디로 가셨나요?\r\nA: 평택으로 피난갔어요. 6월 28일날, 새벽 3시에. \r\n\r\nQ: 누구누구 가셨어요?\r\nA: 6월 25일날 전쟁이 났었고, 우리가 28일날에 피난가쎳어요. 사촌들, 가족들이랑 갔지. 난리가 났지, 뭐. \r\n\r\nQ: 뭐 들고 가셨어요? \r\nA: 아무것도 못가져갓어요. 돈은 얼마 없었고, 가지고 있었던것만 가져 갔지. 그땐 다 죽는줄 알아서 생각 없었어요. \r\n\r\nQ: 평택으로 가셧을때 몇일 걸려서 가셨어요?  A: 하루요. \r\n\r\nQ: 걸어서 평택으로 내려갓는데 그때 길이 좁앗어요. 6월 25일날 새벽 3시에 전쟁이 있었는데 6얼 28일날 서울에 도착했어요 빨갱이들이. 도착하는 즉시 건너가기 못하게 한강 다리를 공경하고 폭발 시켰어요,  육군 공병대가. 그때 한강 다리가 하나만 있었다고. \r\n\r\nQ: 제일 기억나는 고통스러웠던 순간이 뭐였어요?\r\nA: 아이! 그땐 다 죽는 목슴이였지! 지금 나한테 뭐가 고통스러운지 물어보는건가? 아이고 참. 아니 내가 대방동에서 살다가 새벽 3시 20분에 다리가 끊어지는 바람에 놀래가지고, 땅이 흔들리고 집에 흔들리고 그러니까 놀래서 전부 길에 나와보니까 사람들이 엉망으로 반성을 치면서 누구야 누구야 소리지르면서 난리가 났었지 뭐. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁이 끝나고 어땠어요?\r\nA: 3년후, 빨갱이들이 와가지고 낙동간까지 갔었어요. 그놈의 새끼들이 쳐들어와서. 우리는 공주로 피난을 했고 그때 난리가 났었지. 그 3년간을 피난을 해가지고 돌아다니다가 서울로 왔지.

At the time of the war, Mr. Chun was traveling here and there in an attempt to make some business. After hearing that the war had started, Mr. Chun returned to his home where his mother lived. Lots of things began to happen. Hired by the Communist force, the neighborhood gangsters began to round up the teachers, pastors, and wealthy members of the town and threw them into the city jail. Once there, the civilians were subject to forced confessions and false accusations.  Mr. Chun’s uncle and cousin, who had been doing community service at the local church, felt impending danger and fled to the South before anyone else in the family. Mr. Chun had heard his cousin had already started to move to the South because the Communist had captured him and threatened to put him to death because he “believed in the gods.” Left behind by his uncle, Mr. Chun fell victim to the local gangsters and was forced to receive training at the military base camp. \r\n\r\nPrior to the war, Mr. Chun worked in a Japanese owned department store in North Korea. When asked about his most vivid memory of the war, Mr. Chun explained there were two, but began to focus on one. While forming a line to enter the war zone, him and his soldiers were hit by the UN airplanes dropping bombs from above. They began to run and one soldier exclaimed, “You can’t go to the war now! You will die, so run away!” Mr. Chun and his soldiers quickly ran for their lives. Remembering his cousin who went to Seoul, Mr. Chun changed directions from his fellow soldiers and headed towards the South. Upon his unexpected arrival, there was nobody he knew or could call upon, and there were no forms of employment available. Thus, Mr. Chun decided to join the army in order to survive. As a result of the war, Mr. Chun was forced to leave his mother, father, older sister, and younger brother in North Korea when he escaped to the South. \r\n\r\nRegarding his view on the Korean war, Mr. Chun expressed, it is cruel and characterized by pain and suffering. “War is only tragedy.” To see his core soldiers banished away or dead, Mr. Chun had a difficult time simply watching helplessly as his comrades fell down one by one. This was one of the hardest moments to deal with. After the war had ended, the first thing that occurred to him was the hope that he would be able to see his family sometime soon. However, one, then two years passed, and the relationship between North and South Korea did not show any signs of improvement. So, Mr. Chun ended up marrying a single woman and gave up his hopes of seeing his parents and siblings once again. Although the war had ended, the sad reality was that Mr. Chun was unable to return to his family, and his family was barred from finding him in the South. \r\n\r\nAfter the Communist party took over, Mr. Chun claimed there was a huge change as a consequence of the war. The “life of peace” Korea had held had disappeared, and people became suspicious of one another. What had been a serene environment had changed to one of hostility and betrayal, and there was a constant fear and feeling of someone watching over you. This was the general mood in North Korea at the time Mr. Chun was there. People would purposely report each other and accuse them of hoarding wealth or being “greedy”; this would be an automatic ticket to the Communist jail. When asked what had changed with the war, Mr. Chun expressed how it had affected his personal life. The U.S. army was almost captured by North Korean attackers on the field, but he passed on useful information which had helped them foresee the attack. This connection gave Mr. Chun a job after the war ended, and allowed him to manage a dry cleaning store in the U.S. military camp. On the lives of common civilians, Mr. Chun spoke of his brief experience as a medical aid in the army. He helped in distributing medicine to the sick people of the towns, and the civilians were often found struck with extreme hunger and suffering. \r\n\r\nOn the state of the war, Mr. Chun highlighted the unexpected nature of the war itself and the shock it gave to Korean civilians. The war began on Sunday, June 25th, and many of the Korean soldiers were on vacation. Nobody was prepared for the war - In the words of Mr. Chun, “If Korea had known there was going to be an attack, what kind of military would send off their soldiers on vacation?” The South had no preparation whatsoever and was not ready for the war. The people, then, were to suffer an even greater shock from what was to happen. Mr. Chun explained, by the time the South had realized what was going on, the North had pushed the border further South. Many people created makeshift armies which were unorganized and unfit for war, but it was all they could do in the short span of time to fight against their enemies. They were pushed to Pusan as well. \r\n\r\nMr. Chun then expressed, “50 years has passed since we declared a temporary break in the war. However, despite the passing of 50 years, North Korea has not approved of the open visitation of outside North Koreans to the North. Although I would like to go back to my hometown and visit my family, I cannot. This is the tragic reality of war, and the exact reason why war is something we, as humans, should make sure to avoid at all costs.” \r\n\r\nQ: 육이오 전쟁 났을때 뭐하고 계셨어요?\r\nA: 장사좀 해볼려고 여기저기 돌아다녔는데, 전쟁이 났다는 소식을 듣고 어머니가 계신 집으로 갔어요. 동네 건달들이 선생님들, 목사님들을 잡고 부자들도 잡고 간빵에 넣었다. 자하비판을 시키고 나중에 공개처형을 했다. 사람들 모아놓고 죽였다. 삼촌하고 내 사촌은 교회에서 장노로서 봉사하고 있었다. 위험을 느껴서 남쪽으로 먼저 도주했다. 그런데 나는 이민군한테 잡혀서 훌련소러 가서 이민군이 되는 훌련을 받았다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁 전에 뭐 하셨어요? 일상생활은 어땠어요? \r\nA: 일본백화점에서 일했다, 북한에서.\r\n\r\nQ: 제일 기억나는 기억이 있으신지요?\r\nA: 두가지가 있다. 우리가 줄을 지어 가지고 전쟁터로 가는데 이민군은 밀려서  만나게 되었다. UN군 비행기 폭격이 있을때 모두 흐터졌는데 한 이민군이 나에게 말했다. “우리는 졌다. 얼른 도망 가야되. 너도 살려면 도망가.” 라고 했다. 그래서 모두 도망쳤다. 난 사촌을 찾아서 서울로 남쪽으로 내려갔다. 서울에 와보니 아무도 아는 사람이 없었고 전쟁이 나서 할 수 있는 일이 없었다. 그래서 군대에 입대하게 되었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 가족을 잃어 버린 사람 있나요?\r\nA: 엄마, 아버지, 누나, 동생, 모두 다 두고 나만 서울로 왔다.\r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁에대해서 어떻게 생각하세요?\r\nA: 잔인하고 고통스러웠지. 옆에 동료가 쓰러지는 것을 멍하니 보고 있었다. 아무것도 할수 있는게 없었고, 바라 보고만 있었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁이 끝나고나서 무슨 생각하셨어요?\r\nA: 곧 가족을 볼수 있다는 희망을 갖게 되었다. 그러나 일년, 이년이 지나도 북과 남의 관계는 좋아지질 않았다. 나는 한 여자를 만나서 결혼을 하게 되었고 부모를 만나고 형제를 만나는 기대는 포기하게 되었다. 하지만 가족은 우리한테 올 수 없었고, 나도 돌아 갈 수 없었다. 그게 슬픈 현실이라는걸. \r\n\r\nQ: 공산당이 정권을 잡고 무엇이 달라졌는가? \r\nA: 편안하게 살던 분위기가 없어졌어. 사람과 사람끼리 서로 감시하게 되었다. 누군가가 반동 분자로서 다른 사람을 고발하는 일이 많아 졌다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁을 통해서 무엇이 달라졌다고 생각합니까?\r\nA: 전쟁을 통해서 미군대 대병력이 이민군에게 포위 당해서 몰살 당할 위기에 있었는데, 내가 정보를 줘서 미리 후퇴할 수 있었다. 그것이 인연이 되어 나는 전쟁이 끝나고 미군 부대내에서 일을 할 수 있었다. 그때 대대장이 부대안에 새탁소를 운영 할수 있게 도와주웠다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁동에 일반사람들은 어떻게 살았는가? \r\nA: 나는 위생병이여서 군이 지나가는 동네 마다 아픈 사람들에게 약을 주기도 했다. 사람들은 먹을것이 없고 너무나 불안했었지. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁상태는 어땠어요?\r\nA: 1949년에 일본이 가고, 2년동안에 전쟁이 시작했다. 전쟁은 6월 25일, 일요일에 시작해서 많은 군인들은 휴가 갔었지. 아무 준비도 없었지. 우리가 전쟁이 이러날 줄 알았으면 군인들을 휴가 보냈겠는가? 전쟁을 기대하는 나라가 휴가를 보내겠어? 그러니까 남쪽은 준비없이, 이미 그때는 부대는 쫒겨냈어. 어떤 사람들은 부대를 엉터리로 만들어서 싸웠고, 부산 낙동간 근처로 밀렸음. \r\n\r\nQ: 지금은 전쟁에대해서 어떻게 생각합니까?\r\nA: 휴전한지 50년이 지났음. 50년이 지나도 북한은 고향방문을 허락하지 않았다. 지금도 가고싶어도 고향에 갈 수 가 없다. 이래서 전쟁은 꼭 피해야 할 것이다. \r\n','','',0,0),(416,43,324,292,'Shadows of the Korean War','Audio','March 2, 2012 - Interview (Kim Jang Ook)\r\n\r\nQ: What were you doing at the time of the war?\r\nA: I was at the 38th parallel, and was already a soldier at that time. (Translator) Mr. Kim was a sergeant in the intelligent service agency. \r\n\r\nQ: What was your life like prior to the war? What were you doing before the war had started?\r\nA: (Translator) In 1947, Mr. Kim came down from North Korea to South Korea. Right before the war, he was 17 years old. At that age, he started to receive Japanese military training to be in the army. Mr. Kim said he had a very difficult time because there was poor food and clothes since the Korean government didn’t have money yet, at the time. There was a new Korean governor who did not have much money and could not support army training. . When the Korean War occurred, Mr Kim was a “five ranks” soldier and became the first sergeant. \r\n\r\nQ: What was your most vivid recollection of the war?\r\nA: (Translator) When North Korea pushed them down to the South, all the way to Naktong, they were ready for the war, but South Korea was not prepared at all. The South was pushed all the way down and Mr. Kim and the army were scared that if the last remaining line of defense was broken, they would all be finished. So they fought for their lives. Mr. Kim saw a lot of bombing every day and hour after hour. People were dying, wounded everywhere. The most difficult time for him was when the U.S. Army started to push out to North Korea. They had many victories but in the middle of Korea, at the city of Wonju, he was wounded via gunfire and fell down. For Mr. Kim, personally, it was a matter of life or death. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you experience any loss in the family during the war? Please explain.\r\nA: I lost my mother and my father. But there is no time to think about family when the country is being destroyed. We all thought it was every man for his own, and we considered ourselves pretty much dead. What was there to find out and contact? During the war, there was no signal, no telephones. Everyone was out for themselves. Since it was the time of 1950, there was no method of contact between families. Both me and everyone else had no idea whether our families were alive or dead. How were we to know?\r\n\r\nQ: The availability of food was an issue for many Koreans. How did you struggle through this?\r\nA: There was a group called KSC, made up of Korean civilians, which helped the fighting soldiers by delivering us food during the war. They would make little balls of rice and salt and distribute one to each of us. It wasn’t even rice, it was barley - so it was difficult to make it into a ball. It would fall apart when you tried to eat it. During that time, we had no contact with the U.S, and so we were only left with Japanese guns. It wasn’t until later when we received an upgrade in military equipment, but before then, everything we used was Japanese.\r\n\r\nQ: Were you able to listen to the radio or hear announcements on the news? Or were they restricted?\r\nA: There was nothing. \r\n\r\nQ: What was your most difficult, or painful experience during the war? \r\nA: I saw death many, many times, but I had to grow used to it as a sergeant. The lesser ranking soldiers needed to receive more training, but they barely received any. I’m sure they received the most minimal extent of training, but none of them knew how to properly maneuver a gun. One memory which I cannot forget to this day involved one of the younger soldiers. There was a young, new soldier who only had 6 weeks of training. It was his first time training with a Japanese weapon. After the war occured, 1 month later, we started to receive new arms we called M-S. They were United States General Guns. While were were shooting from the trenches, people were coming towards us from left and right. There were bombs being thrown everywhere. Suddenly, the young soldier yelled out to me, “SIR! THE GUN IS BROKEN!! PLEASE HELP ME!” The young soldier did not know how to reload the gun because they were new. As a soldier for many years, I could tell the difference between the sounds of a bomb nearby and one that was heading in a different direction. As soon as I taught him how to reload, he ran back behind me to return to his trench. At the same time, I heard bombs coming from above and dove deep into the trench. When I turned around, the soldier was gone. The bomb had hit his body directly and there were no remnants of his existence. Although I have witnessed many deaths in my life, that was the most crushing death that has remained in my memory. \r\n\r\nQ: Was there ever a time where you interacted with the other side?\r\nA: I always saw them but only in combat. There was one time, however, where we captured a wounded lower ranking North Korean soldier. Usually we kill them as soon as we capture them - do you know why? This is because all Korean soldiers had the same emotional mentality. “Since you are the ones who killed my mother and father, you deserve to die immediately.” Most South Korean soldiers had a bad memory of Communist governments. After the Japanese colonial period, Russia came and began to kill people who were intelligent or rich because they wanted to change our country to communists. We were emotionally very dried. However, this North Korean soldier was very good looking. He begged and pleaded for mercy, and I asked him, “What’s wrong with you?” It was a brief interaction. I could tell by his dialect he was from the same hometown as my father and so I let him live. I sent him to the prisoner arrested camp hospital instead. \r\n\r\nQ: Through the Korean war, what responsibilities do you feel you had to take on?\r\nA: The mentality that I had to protect the country no matter what. You can call it nationalistic pride? A love for the country. The gripping belief that before family, and even before myself, I had to save the country. The country was first before anything. Maybe this is because I grew up in a mentally anti-Communist setting. In the army, I was part of the CIC - Counter Intelligence Corps. \r\n\r\nQ: As a result of the war, what do you feel has changed? \r\nA: War itself is a miserable, wretched thing. America had access to nuclear weapons, and that was a fairly big deal back then. Korea would not have been able to live on its own without the help of America; that’s an obvious story. Simply put, through the involvement of America, we were able to live for a few more years. Our food came from America as well. As a result of the war, however, everyone saw too much cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity. It was simply a merciless time of suffering. When the South Korean army started to win victories, we moved the war line and began pushing it up. While doing so, many North Korean soldiers gave up and started to run away. The South Korean army would pick the younger North Koreans, grabbing any soldiers, to help their army system - carrying bullets, food, simple errands like that. They used North Koreans to support the South Korean cause. However, they began to grow suspicious and thought, “maybe these young men could be helping North Korea and feeding them inside information.” We rounded up all of the young North Korean soldiers and ordered them to run away. Before that, our superiors had given us the order to shoot them from behind while they were running away. I could not do this. But at the same time, it was an order from our superiors; how could we refuse? Many of the soldiers and myself pretended to shoot and instead we aimed for the ground or the sky. Things like that, as a result of war... it is just simply in humane. \r\n\r\nQ: How did you feel when you heard the war was over?\r\nA: From the army, we had already received a notice that the war was over. But by that time, I had been shot in the leg, and so I was retired from the army. I had heard that the war would be stopped fairly soon since North Korea and South Korea were arranging a meeting with the U.N. to stop the war. I had heard this many times, and it was 1953. \r\n','816780 - 03 (Kim Jang Ook).mp3','audio/mp3',23663411,1161839),(417,43,323,293,'Shadows of the Korean War','Fieldnotes','March 2, 2012 - Interview (Lee Kum Soo)\r\n\r\nAt the time of the war, Mrs. Lee was working in the farm behind her house. She could hear the loud noises of planes outside, and ran into the house to ask her mother what it was. Mrs. Lee’s mother said they were probably practicing military activities, but Mrs. Lee had a hard time believing it because the clouds were darker than normal. When her mother turned on the radio, they announced that the war had begun, and the “reds” were getting close to the Hangang river. They were advised to move to a safe place, but Mrs. Lee and her family stayed where they were. Mrs. Lee remembers a night where two communist soldiers came to their house asking for food and water. They were not hostile, but demanded to be fed. Mrs. Lee did not escape because Taejun was far enough at the time from the center of action, and she could not leave her younger siblings behind. \r\n\r\nThe hardest part of the war, as far as Mrs. Lee can remember, is the inability for her family and herself to exercise the freedom they had before the war. There was nowhere for them to go because most of the towns were later demolished, and they were to live a low, inconspicuous life to avoid any unwanted attention. It was difficult for her to grasp the concept of war and why such tragedy was happening to her people. When asked about her view on the American presence, Mrs. Lee praised the Western soldiers as “angels” because without them, Korea would not be able to win the war. Her only encounter with the opposing force was when they visited her home to ask for food. Although they did not hurt her family, Mrs. Lee claims they were very insistent. According to Mrs. Lee, what she felt had changed after the war had ended, was the realization that peace is something one cannot take for granted. It is extremely valuable and precious in itself, and although after the war, peace was somewhat achieved, Korea was left in a miserable state and nobody was living a happy life. Because they lived in the countryside, Mrs. Lee was able to support herself and her family with food from the fields and stocks. They were also able to make flour noodles upon receiving food from the Western help. \r\n\r\nRegarding her most difficult memories of the war, Mrs. Lee emphasized the constant feeling of fear. Because she had to act as a second mother to her six other siblings, there was no time for her to think. Not only did she have to fear for her own life, but the wellfare of her entire family as well. When they had escaped to Pusan, the trains were packed and her family was unable to board the train. People were climbing on the top in order to escape, and it was only until someone helped them get on top that they were given the chance to flee. For Mrs. Lee, one of the hardest parts was dealing with the cries of her younger siblings; she could not give them the food they wanted, and her back was often tired from carrying her younger sister on her back. Half jokingly, Mrs. Lee blamed her short height on this responsibility. Moreover, she struggled with the common mentality that everyone was out for themselves. You could not think of helping others during the war because you had your own family to take care of; however, at the same time, those who were without food sought help from those who did in the small villages. This happened after the war as well. \r\n\r\nMrs. Lee continued - some of the other difficult experiences of the war was seeing her mother suffer. Without any power or strength, she was constantly in a tired and worried state. Thus, Mrs. Lee had to calm her sisters down as they had no idea what was going on. She was not in the right state of mind herself to be doing so; however, she had no choice but to stay strong because they needed to prepare for their next location to escape. One time, Mrs. Lee had to divide a small piece of food between 6 people. It was obviously not enough to satisfy anyone’s stomachs, but there was simply not enough food available. When the war had occurred, Mrs. Lee blamed everyone. She felt anger towards the government, and especially towards the President. What could the president possibly be doing, and where was his head even at, to let the country be made into a state such as this? Mrs. Lee believed the government was both incompetent and irresponsible; in no way a protector of their own people. After the war was over, Mrs. Lee expressed, there was nothing to see in the city. Everything was destroyed, the stores were not open, and Korea had no choice but to reconstruct itself from the ashes. \r\n\r\nHer most exciting moment, however, was when the U.N. soldiers asked her if she wanted a piece of chocolate. Mrs. Lee said she did not know if it was a grenade or a gun (jokingly), so she stared at it for a long time. But when she put it into her mouth, it was so sweet. It was the first time she tasted something so lovely and through that, she was able to discover the taste of chocolate. In terms of the aftermath of war, Mrs. Lee does not approve of the continued presence of American soldiers in Korea. “When we needed their help, it was okay,” she claims, “however, by refusing to leave when we do not need them anymore, Westerners are disrespecting our rights and not giving us the acknowledgement we deserve.”\r\n\r\nQ: 6/25 전쟁 났을때 어디에 계셨어요? \r\nA:  농밭에서 일하고 있었다. 비행기소리가 너무나 커서 집으로 뛰어들어갔다. 엄마한테 무슨일인지 물어보니 군비행 연습 하고있다고 말하셨다. 난 엄마에게 아니, 구름이 너무나 검검하다. 어머님이 라디오를 틀으니까 전쟁이 시작했다고, 빨갱이들이 한강에 가깝다고 안전한곳으로 도망가라고 말했다. 어머니께서 뒷산에서 계래군이 나타나서 물하고 음식좀 달라고 그랬다고 하셨다. \r\n\r\nQ: 피난은 어디로 가셨나요?\r\nA: 대전에선 피난가지 않았어요. 왜나면 북한인들이 한강으로 오고 있다는 보도를 받고 서울하고 대전은 떨어지는 곳에 있었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 제일 고통스러웠던 순간이 뭐였어요?\r\nA: 밖에 나갈수도 없었고, 타운에선 갈때도 없고. 밤에는 불을 다 꺼라, 라고 말하셨다. 왜나면 적군이 사람들이 여기서 살고 있는것을 티내면 안된다. 그래서 우리는 불을 끄고 검검한 방에서 바깥에서 무서운 사람들이 올까바 겁이 났었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 미국 구인들은 어땠어요?\r\nA: 난 천사들이라고 생각했다. 우리의 희망이라고 할수도.\r\n\r\nQ: 적하고 대화한적은 있었어요?\r\nA: 그때 한번 밖에 없었다. 우리를 다치게 하지 않았지만 음식만 달라고 했었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁을 통해서 무엇이 달라졌다고 생각합니까? \r\nA: 평화는 정말 소중한것이라는걸 꺠달았다. 전쟁후에는 평화를 찾았기때문에 모든게 달라졌다. \r\n\r\nQ: 집이나 길가들가게가 문닫았을텐데 음식은 어떻게 해결했나요\r\nA: 시골에서 농사를 둬서 뒤에는 옥수수밭이 있어서 앞에는 감자 밭이 있었어. 농사에서 뜯어 먹었다. 수제비도 잔뜩 먹었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁통에 뭐가 제일 힘들었어요? \r\nA: 생각할수가 없었어요 무서워서. 피난을 가는데 열차를 탈수가 없었어요. 부산으로 도망가는 차를 타야되는데 기차를 탈수 가 없었어요 사람들이 많아서. 기차위에 올라타달라고 외쳤는데 누가 위로 올려줬어요. 기차를 타고 부산으로 갔다. 내 식구들이 아파하는걸 보며는 가슴이 너무 아팠습니다. 서로 무서워서 남생각을 할수가 없었어요. 1살 먹은 내 여동생을 업고 다녔는데 배고파서 울때마다 가슴이 아팠습니다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁을 통해서 어떤 책임들이 당신한테 있었죠?\r\nA: 내 동생들을 봐야했습니다. 엄마 혼자 돌보기에는 너무 힘이 드셨죠. 엄마는 힘이 없고 너무 힘들어서 지쳐있었습니다. 그래서 제가 동생들의 손을 잡고 있어줘야 했고 걔네들을 진정시켰어야 했습니다. 아가들이 너무 놀라서 정신 나간 아이들도 있었습니다. 제 정신이 아니였고 두렵기만 했습니다. 단, 도망가야 한다는것만 알고 있었습니다. 백속에 옥수수빵이 있었는데 나눠 먹을려고 했는데 6명이 있었습니다. 제가 짜라서 애기들 입속에 나눴습니다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁이 났을때 누구한테 물어보고싶었나요? 누구한테 화가 났었나요? \r\nA: 전부. 정치에 하는사람들한테 화가 났었습니다. 특히, 이승만 대통령한테 화가 났었습니다. 대통령은 무엇을 하느라고 전쟁을 이렇게까지 만들었는지 화가 났습니다. \r\n\r\nQ: 전쟁 끝나고 어땠어요? \r\nA: 전쟁은 끝났는데 길바닥은 엉망징창이였어요. 아무것도 볼게 없었습니다. 가게들은 문닫고 한국은 밑바닥부터 다시 시작할 수 밖에 없었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 괭장히 신났던 일은 무엇이였죠?\r\nA: UN군들이 갑작이 나한테 초코릿을 원하냐고 물어봤다. 폭탄인가 총인가 한참 쳐다봤다. 입속에 넣어보니 너무나 달콤했다. 미국사람들이 초코릿을 던지면서 난 처음으로 초코릿 맛을 알게 되었다. \r\n\r\nQ: 지금 미국군인들이 한국에 있다는거에대해서 어떻게 생각합니까?\r\nA: 박청희 대통령때 우리가 도움이 필요 없다고 했을때 계속 있는다면, 그거는 우리의 권리 가 없게 되겠죠. 전쟁을 말렸을땐 고마웠지만, 이제는 우리의 권리를 인정해주고 딸아주면 좋겠다.

We weren’t allowed to listen to the radio at the time so we had turned all of the lights off and listened. They announced that the South had attacked the North, and that a war was going to start. My brother suggested we should go with our family and move elsewhere. \r\n\r\nQ: What was your life like prior to the war? What were you doing before the war had started?\r\nA: I was young at that time, maybe your age. How old are you now?\r\n\r\nQ: 21. You were my age at the time of the war?\r\nA: I was born in 1934 so I think, maybe a bit younger than you.\r\n\r\nQ: Where did you go after the war was announced?\r\nA: My father had relatives not too far away, but slightly above where our home was. It was my uncle’s house, who was the oldest of the family, and so we wanted to bring everyone and move together if we could. My father thought my uncle would know best. We headed towards the North but before we could reach my uncle’s house, my brother said we must go back South because many of the other civilians were escaping in that direction. My father could not go with us because he wanted to see if my uncle’s family was okay, so he sent my brother, mother, my younger sibling, and me to go ahead. If my brother stayed in North Korea, he would be forced to join the army. So we crossed the Taetong River with our own bodies as there were no boats at the time. Imagine - we had no clothes to change in, we could only focus on keeping moving to reach Seoul as quickly as possible. We later went to Pusan but returned to Seoul shortly after.\r\n\r\nQ: What was your most vivid recollection of the war?\r\nA: The things I saw on the way to Seoul, it is such a shame. There were young babies who had no mothers, crying on the street with nobody to take care of them. It was complete chaos in the streets, and you never knew if a bomb could come somewhere near you. We were very lucky. Nobody knew what was going on and what we were to do; the only thing we could think about was how to survive. When you are put in a state of war, every day is filled with anxiety and dread. Even though you want to stop everything, you cannot do it. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you ever have any interaction or encounters with Western or enemy soldiers?\r\nA: I saw them many times, but I never talked to them because I could not communicate. I also had a lot of fear. There is a story, two American soldiers asked a South Korean, “Are you communist?!” Because the South Korean didn’t know any English except “OK,” he said, “OK OK!” So the American soldiers killed him. I don’t know if this is true or not, but it is just a funny story I heard. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you experience any loss in the family during the war? Please explain.\r\nA: I did not hear any news from my father after we left to the South that day. He said he would meet us South with my uncle’s family after we left, but there was no way we could contact him and we never heard from my uncle or father after that day. \r\n\r\nQ: The availability of food was an issue for many Koreans. How did you struggle through this?\r\nA: Each time we moved places, we would ask those well off to give us some food. Many times there were not enough so my brother and I looked for what we could; some people were nice enough to share, but we were not the only families to share with. We were able to eat with rice and salt most of the time. \r\n\r\nQ: What did you think of the war you were in at that time?\r\nA: Painful, what more? It broke my heart to see my brother working so hard every day; he went out to look for any job he could find to protect my mother and sister, but there was nothing. How could there be any jobs when everything was destroyed? We did not know when it was going to be over. \r\n\r\nQ: What was your most difficult, or painful experience during the war? \r\nA: We applied to look for my father but received no response. We had many hopes that escaping to Seoul would give us a better life, and it did, but Seoul, too, was in a very bad state. During the Korean war, nobody was rich and living a beautiful life. Everyone was suffering in their own way. In North Korea, there was a lot more fear and hidden activity than the South because we were not allowed to believe in God. They could have thrown us in jail but when we were in Seoul, the South Koreans could be equally as violent as the Red Communists. Simple dangers during the war could cause life or death, and although I did not get hit by a bomb, it is the mental stress you have that takes a toll. You have no idea what is going to happen to you and you are surrounded by constant violence, war, and danger. Is that not painful in itself? To see the same blood of people killing one another? \r\n\r\nQ: During the war setting, what would you say was the hardest struggle to endure?\r\nA: No food, no reassurance, and being separated from my father and his family. I wish there was some way I could have seen my father, but even though we applied and filled out the forms to search for him after the war, nothing was done. It was constant terror of either losing my brother or death, but luckily we were able to come where we have now. We must be thankful to God for that. \r\n\r\nQ: Through the Korean war, what responsibilities do you feel you had to take on?\r\nA: When carrying my sister through the river, I was very tired and nervous. My brother and mother carried what little we could bring with us, but we later had to sell most of our possessions for food and assistance from others. I could not show my weakness in front of my brother because I knew how much he loved us and was dying to protect us. But I’m sure my brother could tell without me saying anything. \r\n\r\nQ: As a result of the war, what do you feel has changed? \r\nA: Because the Americans helped stopped the war, Koreans have become more westernized. We want to look like them and look at my grandson, who does not even have a Korean girlfriend. If the United States wants to help us, they should let North Korea allow families to move freely between the South and North. I do not think anyone can be of help unless North Korea changes their mentality. \r\n\r\nQ: How did you feel when you heard the war was over?\r\nA: Relief. The work of a miracle. I prayed to God as soon as I found out that we were alive, and to please help me find my father. After the war has happened, I never want to be part of a war again. It must never occur again in Korea. What we call war is horrible and inhumane; when there is death and dying of families and young children, how can we say that war is justified/needed?

We were very very weak. But I had no idea that a war would break out.\r\n\r\nQ: What was your life like prior to the war? What were you doing before the war had started?\r\nA: I was very popular with the women when I was young (laughter), but shhh - do not tell my wife. My family was very wealthy because my father could speak many languages; he was a translator in the government but after the war, we became very poor. \r\n\r\nQ: What was your most vivid recollection of the war?\r\nA: When I saw the soldiers with tanks, I was afraid that South Korea would not be able to win the war. The Chinese and North Korean soldiers were good fighters, and had a tougher mentality than us. Do you know why? People who live in colder climates tend to be more brutal and harsh in their thinking. If you look at South American countries, the men live a very easy and lazy life. If they want to eat, they can lay down and pick the fruit off a tree. But for Russians and the Chinese, people up North, they had to use their bodies for fishing, diving, and had to fight nature with their own physical body. They had no mercy and were bloodthirsty communists. Imagine waking up one day and everything around you is turned into ashes. What will you do then? There was no form of sanity during the war; I had to fend for myself. One time I had to steal an armful of barley because there was nothing else to eat. I would have never thought of stealing if it were not for my live or die mentality. You become a hungry animal when you are during war. All you want to do is survive and kill. That was the only concern for men. On the trains headed to Pusan, I remember seeing people throwing each other off - although this was a rare occassion from what I saw, I could not understand what had come to be of the Korean nation. War had changed us to become inhumane and evil. Why cause suffering for one another when we are all of the same blood?\r\n\r\nQ: Did you ever have any interaction or encounters with Western or enemy soldiers? Did they treat Korean soldiers any differently or show any signs of discrimination?\r\nA: Yes, through the army. They were very happy men. They came to help us and did not treat us with racism, they waved and we waved back. \r\n\r\nQ: Did you experience any loss in the family during the war? Please explain.\r\nA: My older sister. I do not know how she died. \r\n\r\nQ: The availability of food was an issue for many Koreans. How did you struggle through this?\r\nA: I had to steal from storage houses because it was the easiest to access. The American soldiers also gave us food which helped us survive, too. We shared the food with our neighbors and those who had food were willing to share with others. I could only serve in the army for a short period of time, as I was able to find a job in one of the refuge camps. \r\n\r\nQ: What did you think of the war you were in at that time?\r\nA: Horrible. War is a terrible thing. People just killed and killed, and it was an endless cycle. There is nothing good that comes from war - even if it is over politics or ideology, if you were there to see how much the Koreans suffered because of the war, you would never want anything like that again. War is vicious and turns men into uncivilized creatures. By killing each other, leaving women and children to starve to death, turning against one another, the war degraded us into animals. You die, kill, rinse and repeat. It must not happen again.\r\n\r\nQ: What was your most difficult, or painful experience during the war? \r\nA: I saw an old grandmother being beaten to death for her involvement in the independence movement. Even females were treated very badly, and the Chinese and Russian soldiers took advantage of many South Korean women. If I had been in the army when I was there, I would have shot them myselves. But when I was working in the refuge camp, there was nothing I could do but watch these atrocities as the camp was a way for us to get extra food rations secretly. We were very blessed to have access to food, because most people did not. After and during the war, Korea had no source of income. People rushed to slaughter single animals and would boil the bones and drink what they could. That is why we have bone soup now.\r\n\r\nQ: During the war setting, what would you say was the hardest struggle to endure?\r\nA: To see South Korea being pushed back by the North made me feel anxiety and distress. The thought that we could lose the war - we did not see it coming - made me angry and in a way, humiliated. North Korea had much greater military strength than South Korea, and they had been prepared in number and force. I was a young boy back then and like everyone else, we had many dreams and hopes as students. After the war, you could not see any hope when looking around at the blown up remnants. Imagine yourself - you are filled with goals and dreams about your future. We were just the same, but we could not even have the chance to think about it. All we cared about was how to survive the next day, or where to seek safe refuge. \r\n\r\nQ: Through the Korean war, what responsibilities do you feel you had to take on?\r\nA: It was a mental and physical battle between myself. In the context of war, everyone shares the responsibility of trying to stay alive. Everything was a gamble because you did not know who you could trust, which way would not lead into a bomb, or how you could preserve your own safety. I wanted to stay with my family but I could not even think of them at that time. \r\n\r\nQ: As a result of the war, what do you feel has changed? \r\nA: North Korea has not changed at all. They are now living as slaves by a dictator. I think we have realized how important it is to have a nation to call our own. However, although nobody would even dream or bare with the idea of another war in Korea, South Korea must prepare themselves in the case that it does occur. Korea has been making progress economically but politically, they remain the same. Think about what happened with Germany. Although North Koreans are completely different from us now because they do not carry the same capacity to understand or accept other beliefs, we must consider the idea of reunification as a possibility if we are to strengthen Korea as a nation. It is the lack of economic sources which is the problem. The sad part is that the war was unavoidable, however, what is even more tragic is how it affected the actual Korean citizens.\r\n\r\nQ: How did you feel when you heard the war was over?\r\nA: Towards the end, part of me could sense that it was coming to an end. I thought that Korea should not experience something like this ever again. \r\n','','',0,0),(420,43,327,296,'Short Fieldwork Assignment','Fieldnotes','My father, Scott Kim, explained the family celebration of Chu-seok, the Korean version of Thanksgiving.
